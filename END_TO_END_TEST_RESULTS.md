## 🔍 Data Quality Analysis

### Real vs Fake Data Comparison

**Before (Fake Data):**
```javascript
// Generic templated content
html: `<html><title>${competitor.name}</title>...`
text: `Welcome to ${competitor.name}\nWe provide excellent...`
// Hardcoded, predictable content
```

**After (Real Scraping):**
```javascript
// Actual competitor website content
html: "<html>...[159,563 chars of real HTML]..."
title: "ButcherBox: Meat Delivery Subscription"
// Real competitive intelligence
```

### Content Analysis

| Competitor | Real Title | Content Type | Business Focus |
|------------|------------|--------------|----------------|
| Test Competitor | "Example Domain" | Demo site | Testing/Documentation |
