## 📊 **IMPACT ASSESSMENT**

### **Unit Test Success Rate Improvement**

**Before Fixes 8.3 & 8.4**:
- ProductScrapingService: 10/15 tests passing (67%)
- ComparativeReportService: 2/21 tests passing (9.5%)
- **Combined**: 12/36 tests passing (33%)

**After Fixes 8.3 & 8.4**:
- ProductScrapingService: 15/15 tests passing (100%)
- ComparativeReportService: 21/21 tests passing (100%)
- **Combined**: 36/36 tests passing (100%)

**Net Improvement**: **+67 percentage points** in targeted test success rate

### **Overall Test Suite Impact**

**Key Achievements**:
- ✅ **Service Layer Stability**: Core business logic tests now reliable
- ✅ **Mock Infrastructure**: Proven patterns for complex service testing
- ✅ **CI/CD Readiness**: Target services now have stable test foundation
- ✅ **Development Velocity**: Faster feedback loops for core services

**Remaining Challenges**:
- Other unit test files still have failures (comparativeAnalysisService, productService, etc.)
- Overall unit test success rate needs further improvement for full production readiness
