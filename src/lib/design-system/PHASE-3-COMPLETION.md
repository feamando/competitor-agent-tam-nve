- Created `useTheme` hook for theme management
- Implemented theme context with type safety

#### 6.3 Update existing components to use theme-aware styling ✅
- Verified existing components already use theme-aware classes
- Components properly utilize design tokens and dark mode variants
- All UI components respond correctly to theme changes

#### 6.4 Implement CSS-in-JS alternative for complex theming needs ✅
- Created advanced variant system in `src/lib/design-system/variants.ts`
- Implemented `VariantManager` for dynamic theme-aware styling
- Provided utilities for compound variants and theme-responsive classes

#### 6.5 Test theme consistency across all components ✅
- Created comprehensive theme testing suite
- Tests cover theme switching, persistence, and component consistency
- Includes accessibility and performance testing for themes

#### 6.6 Document theming best practices and guidelines ✅
- Created detailed documentation in `src/lib/design-system/README.md`
- Provided usage examples and migration guides
- Documented best practices for theme-aware development

## Key Deliverables

### 1. Theme System (`src/lib/design-system/theme.ts`)

### 4. Testing Framework (`src/lib/design-system/testing.ts`)
- Comprehensive testing utilities
- Theme-aware test functions
- Accessibility and performance testing tools

### 5. Type System (`src/types/design-system.ts`)
- Complete TypeScript definitions
- Consistent prop interfaces
- Event handler and utility types

### 6. Documentation
- Complete README with usage examples
- Naming conventions guide
- Best practices and migration guidelines

## Architecture Highlights
