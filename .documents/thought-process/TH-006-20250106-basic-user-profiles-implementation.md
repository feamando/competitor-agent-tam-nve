# TH-006-20250106-Basic-User-Profiles-Implementation

## Overview
- **Project:** Competitor Research Agent
- **Date:** 2025-01-06
- **RequestID:** TH-006-20250106-basic-user-profiles-implementation

## Problem Analysis

**Current State:**
- Application currently uses mock authentication with `mock@example.com`
- All users see all projects, competitors, and reports
- No data segregation by user profile
- Authentication is completely removed (D-012 documents this)

**User Story:**
"As a user I want to be able to run competitor analyses that are relevant for me, my products, competitors and see my reports."

**Problem Statement:**
Without profiles, all users see all data creating an unmanageable mess for multiple users.

## Requirements Analysis

### Core Requirements (Explicit):
1. **NO AUTHENTICATION** - Just email-based profiles
2. **Simple Access Flow:** Email entry → Max session duration
3. **Data Scoping:** All data filtered by profile
4. **Minimal UI Changes:** Logout button in header
5. **Profile Associations:** Products, Competitors, Projects, Reports all scoped to profiles

### Technical Requirements (Derived):
1. **Profile Model:** Email + associations only
2. **Database Schema:** New Profile table, foreign keys on existing tables
3. **Session Management:** Browser-based, max duration
4. **Data Filtering:** All queries scoped by profile
5. **UI Components:** Access popup, logout button

## Technical Feasibility Assessment

### Confidence Level: HIGH
- Straightforward database modeling
- Current mock user system provides foundation
- Minimal authentication complexity
- Clear scoping requirements

### Risk Assessment: LOW
- No complex authentication flows
- No external integrations required
- Clear data model relationships
- Minimal UI changes needed

## Implementation Strategy

### 1. Minimal Change Approach
- Leverage existing mock user infrastructure
- Add profile layer on top of current system
- Reuse existing session management patterns
- Minimal schema changes with careful foreign key additions

### 2. Data Model Strategy
```
Profile (new)
├── id
├── email (unique)
├── createdAt
├── updatedAt

Existing Tables (add profileId):
├── User -> Profile (many-to-one)
├── Project -> Profile (many-to-one)
├── Competitor -> Profile (many-to-one)
├── Report -> Project -> Profile (transitive)
```

### 3. Session Strategy
- Browser localStorage/cookies for profile session
- No server-side session complexity
- Max session timeout (configurable)

## Key Considerations

### 1. Migration Path
- Add profileId columns as nullable initially
- Create default profile for existing data
- Gradually enforce profile associations

### 2. UI/UX Simplicity
- Single email input popup
- No password complexity
- Clear logout mechanism
- Minimal visual changes

### 3. Data Integrity
- Proper foreign key constraints
- Cascade delete considerations
- Profile isolation validation

## Assumptions Made

1. **HelloFresh Domain:** User emails are hellofresh.com addresses
2. **Internal Tool:** No security beyond email validation needed
3. **Session Duration:** Max session acceptable for workflow
4. **Data Migration:** Existing data can be associated with default profile
5. **Browser Support:** Modern browser localStorage/cookie support

## Next Steps

1. Create comprehensive task plan (TP-026)
2. Define database schema changes
3. Plan UI component modifications
4. Outline testing strategy
5. Document migration approach

## Questions/Clarifications Needed

None - requirements are clear and feasible with minimal complexity.
