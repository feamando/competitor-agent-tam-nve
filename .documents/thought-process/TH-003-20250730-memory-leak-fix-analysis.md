# Memory Leak Fix Analysis - Thought Process Log

**Project:** Competitor Research Agent Memory Optimization
**Date:** 2025-07-30
**Request ID:** memory-leak-fix-20250730-001

## Problem Analysis

### Critical Issues Identified:
1. **Primary Memory Hog (PID 42884)**: Next.js server consuming 1.3GB RAM with 120% CPU
2. **Memory Growth Pattern**: 20.5% growth from 294MB â†’ 354MB indicating leaks
3. **Emergency Mode Triggers**: System hitting 99%+ memory usage repeatedly
4. **AI Data Accumulation**: Large Bedrock requests/responses not being released
5. **Report Generation Bottlenecks**: 5.8-second requests with massive data structures

### Root Cause Analysis:
- **BedrockService instance caching** without proper cleanup
- **Chat conversation state** accumulating in memory
- **Large JSON snapshot data** being stringified and retained
- **Comprehensive report generation** holding onto competitor website HTML
- **Concurrent AI analysis requests** overwhelming memory capacity

### Technical Context:
- Next.js 15.3.2 development server
- AWS Bedrock integration with Claude 3 Sonnet
- Prisma database with complex relationships
- Real-time memory monitoring system already in place
- Existing memory cleanup mechanisms (ComprehensiveMemoryMonitor)

## Assumptions Made:
1. Application restart resolved immediate crisis but underlying issues remain
2. Memory monitoring system is functioning correctly
3. Database schema doesn't need modification
4. AI analysis functionality must be preserved
5. Development environment patterns will translate to production

## Technical Feasibility Assessment:
- **High feasibility** - specific root causes identified
- **Clear implementation path** - optimize existing components
- **Low risk** - incremental improvements to proven architecture
- **Measurable success criteria** - memory usage metrics available

## Implementation Strategy:
1. **Immediate fixes** - request queuing and data cleanup
2. **Short-term optimizations** - memory management improvements  
3. **Long-term architecture** - streaming and caching strategies

## Risk Considerations:
- Changes to AI analysis flow could affect report quality
- Request queuing might impact user experience
- Memory optimization could introduce new bugs
- Production environment differences need consideration
