## ðŸ”§ Rollback Testing Infrastructure

### Rollback Test Configuration
```typescript
// Test Configuration
timeouts: {
  featureFlagSwitch: 10000,    // 10 seconds
  dataConsistency: 30000,      // 30 seconds
  serviceRollback: 60000,      // 1 minute
  loadTesting: 120000          // 2 minutes
}

// Test Profiles
profiles: {
  emergency: "60s test, 3s flag delay, 5 samples",
  controlled: "300s test, 5s flag delay, 10 samples", 
  full-cycle: "600s test, 10s flag delay, 20 samples"
}
```

### Feature Flag Service Simulation
```typescript
// Feature Flag Management
class FeatureFlagService {
  // Production state simulation
  simulateProductionFlags()
  
  // Emergency rollback
  rollbackToLegacy(reason: string)
  
  // Rollforward procedure
  rollbackToConsolidated(reason: string)
  
  // Audit trail maintenance
  getRollbackHistory()
}
```

### Data Consistency Validation
```typescript
// Data Consistency Testing
class DataConsistencyValidator {
  // Capture service snapshots
  captureDataSnapshot(projectId, serviceVersion)
  
  // Compare across service versions
  validateDataConsistency()
  
  // Structure comparison
  compareAnalysisStructure()
  compareReportStructure()
}
```

### Load Testing During Rollback
```typescript
// Load Testing Configuration
loadProfile: {
  concurrentRequests: 10,
  testDuration: 60000,         // 1 minute
  requestInterval: 1000        // 1 second
}

// Test Phases
phases: [
  "consolidated",      // Before rollback
  "rollback-transition", // During rollback
  "legacy"            // After rollback
]
```

## ðŸš¨ Rollback Decision Criteria

### Automatic Rollback Triggers
| Criteria | Threshold | Window | Action |
|----------|-----------|--------|--------|
| Analysis Service Error Rate | > 10% | 5 minutes | Auto Rollback |
| Reporting Service Error Rate | > 10% | 5 minutes | Auto Rollback |
| Overall System Error Rate | > 5% | 3 minutes | Auto Rollback |
| Response Time P95 | > 90s | 5 minutes | Auto Rollback |
| Memory Usage | > 2GB | 3 minutes | Auto Rollback |
| Health Check Failures | > 3 consecutive | 2 minutes | Auto Rollback |

### Manual Rollback Triggers
- Quality degradation in analysis or reports
- Customer-reported functionality issues
- Security concerns or data integrity issues
- Performance degradation trends

### Decision Matrix
| Metric | Green | Yellow | Red | Action |
|--------|-------|--------|-----|---------|
| Error Rate | < 2% | 2-5% | > 5% | Monitor / Assess / **Rollback** |
| Response Time P95 | < 30s | 30-60s | > 60s | Monitor / Assess / **Rollback** |
| Memory Usage | < 512MB | 512MB-1GB | > 1GB | Monitor / Assess / **Rollback** |
| Quality Score | > 0.8 | 0.7-0.8 | < 0.7 | Monitor / Assess / **Rollback** |

## ðŸ”„ Rollback Procedures

### Phase 1: Emergency Rollback (< 2 minutes)
```bash
# Emergency rollback script
#!/bin/bash
echo "ðŸš¨ EMERGENCY ROLLBACK INITIATED"

# Set feature flags
kubectl set env deployment/api-service \
  CONSOLIDATED_ANALYSIS_V15=false \
  CONSOLIDATED_REPORTING_V15=false \
  LEGACY_SERVICES_FALLBACK=true

# Verify health
curl -f http://localhost:3000/api/health
```

### Phase 2: Controlled Rollback (< 10 minutes)
- Document rollback reason with incident ticket
- Gradual traffic shift: 25% â†’ 50% â†’ 100% to legacy
- Data consistency validation
- Service health monitoring

### Phase 3: Post-Rollback Validation (< 30 minutes)
- End-to-end testing
- Performance verification
- User experience validation
- Data integrity checks

### Rollforward Procedures
- Issue resolution validation
- Pre-rollforward checklist
- Gradual rollforward: 10% â†’ 50% â†’ 100% to consolidated
- Enhanced monitoring for 1 hour
