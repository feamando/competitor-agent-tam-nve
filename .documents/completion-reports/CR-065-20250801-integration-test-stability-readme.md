# Integration Test Stability Improvements

## Overview

This document outlines the fixes implemented for issue 3.2 "Cross-service integration tests failing" from the Production Readiness Remediation Plan. The primary focus was addressing hanging tests, timeout issues, and unstable async operations in integration tests.

## Problem Summary

Integration tests, particularly those involving cross-service operations, were failing due to:

1. **Hanging promises** - Unresolved promises preventing test completion
2. **No timeout handling** - Tests running indefinitely without proper timeouts
3. **Race conditions** - Issues with asynchronous operations completing in unexpected orders
4. **Untracked timeouts** - Timeout callbacks executing after tests had already completed
5. **Missing cleanup** - Resources not being properly released between tests

## Implemented Solutions

### 1. Promise Tracking

Added a global Promise tracking mechanism to monitor all promises created during test execution:

```javascript
// Track pending promises for cleanup
const pendingPromises = new Set();

// Override global Promise to track all instances
global.Promise = class TrackedPromise extends originalPromise {
  constructor(executor) {
    // Implementation tracks promise creation and completion
    // ...
  }
};
```

### 2. Timeout Handling

Implemented comprehensive timeout management to prevent hanging tests:

```javascript
// In test files:
const timeoutPromise = new Promise<never>((_, reject) => {
  safeTimeout(() => {
    reject(new Error(`Test timed out after ${testTimeout}ms`));
  }, testTimeout);
});

// Race the test execution against the timeout
await Promise.race([testPromise, timeoutPromise]);
```

### 3. Test Cleanup Utilities

Created reusable utilities to standardize timeout and promise handling:

- `TimeoutTracker` class to register and clean up timeouts
- `runTestWithTimeout()` function for executing tests with automatic timeout
- `createTimeoutPromise()` for generating consistent timeout promises
- `runTasksWithTimeout()` for parallel tasks with timeout protection

### 4. Safe Test Patterns

Restructured tests to use safer async patterns:

```javascript
it('should execute safely', async () => {
  const testPromise = (async () => {
    // Test logic here that might hang
    // ...
    return true;
  })();
  
  await Promise.race([testPromise, timeoutPromise]);
});
```

### 5. Integration Setup Enhancements

Modified the global integration test setup to:

- Track and clean up promises
- Register proper afterEach/afterAll hooks
- Ensure cleanup runs even when tests fail

## Implementation Details

### Files Modified

1. **src/__tests__/setup/integrationSetup.js**
   - Added promise tracking and cleanup
   - Enhanced teardown processes

2. **src/__tests__/utils/testCleanup.ts**
   - Created utility functions for test stability

3. **src/__tests__/integration/crossServiceValidation.test.ts**
   - Applied timeout protection to all test cases
   - Restructured test logic for stability

4. **scripts/fix-integration-tests.sh**
   - Script to verify and test the fixes

### Verification Process

The stability improvements can be verified by running:

```
bash scripts/fix-integration-tests.sh
```

This script:
1. Verifies the fixes are properly installed
2. Runs the cross-service validation tests
3. Optionally runs all integration tests
4. Reports on test stability

## Before & After Comparison

Before:
- Integration tests would hang indefinitely
- Jest would timeout after long periods (2+ minutes)
- No clear error messages for timing issues
- Resources not properly cleaned up

After:
- Tests fail fast with clear timeout messages
- Maximum test execution time is controlled
- Resources are properly tracked and cleaned up
- Race conditions are explicitly handled

## Best Practices for Integration Tests

For future integration test development:

1. **Always use timeouts** - Wrap long-running operations in Promise.race
2. **Track all resources** - Use the TimeoutTracker for any setTimeout calls
3. **Handle async operations** - Use the runTestWithTimeout utility
4. **Clean up properly** - Ensure all resources are released in afterEach/afterAll
5. **Use test isolation** - Don't share state between tests unless absolutely necessary

## Next Steps

1. Apply these patterns to all integration tests
2. Add monitoring for test execution times
3. Consider implementing automatic test retry for flaky tests
4. Set up metrics to track test stability over time
