- **Auto-Refresh Capability**: Configurable refresh intervals (15s to 5m) for real-time monitoring

## Implementation Details

### 1. Queue Recovery System Architecture

#### Multiple Specialized Queues
```typescript
// Four specialized Bull queues for different recovery scenarios
- recoveryQueue: Bull.Queue         // Automatic retry processing
- deadLetterQueue: Bull.Queue       // Permanent failure management
- manualTriggerQueue: Bull.Queue    // Administrative interventions
- monitoringQueue: Bull.Queue       // Health checks and statistics
```

#### Recovery Configuration
```typescript
interface RetryConfig {
  maxAttempts: 5,           // Maximum recovery attempts
  initialDelayMs: 30000,    // 30 second initial delay
  maxDelayMs: 480000,       // 8 minute maximum delay
  backoffMultiplier: 2,     // Exponential progression
  jitterEnabled: true       // Thundering herd prevention
}
```

### 2. Error-Specific Recovery Strategies

| Error Category | Recovery Strategy | Retry Logic | Max Attempts |
|---------------|------------------|-------------|--------------|
| Network | Exponential Backoff | 30s → 8m with jitter | 5 |
| Service Unavailable | Circuit Breaker + Retry | 3 attempts, then circuit breaker | 3 |
| Authentication | Manual Review | No automatic retry | 0 |
| Rate Limit | Extended Backoff | Longer delays | 5 |
| Resource Exhaustion | Emergency Mode | Fallback generation | 1 |
| External Dependency | Fallback Service | Alternative processing | 3 |

### 3. Dead Letter Queue Management

#### Escalation Criteria
- **Failure Threshold**: 10 consecutive recovery failures
- **Permanent Error Types**: Authentication, authorization, validation failures
- **Resource Exhaustion**: Memory, disk space, quota exceeded
- **Administrative Decision**: Manual escalation to dead letter

#### Dead Letter Job Structure
```typescript
interface DeadLetterJob {
  originalFailedJob: FailedReportJob;
  movedToDeadLetterAt: Date;
  finalError: string;
  requiresManualReview: boolean;
  escalationLevel: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high' | 'critical';
  adminNotes?: string;
  recoveryAttempts: number;
  lastRecoveryAttempt?: Date;
}
```

### 4. Manual Trigger System

#### API Endpoints
- **GET /api/queue-recovery/manual-trigger**: List recoverable jobs with filtering
- **POST /api/queue-recovery/manual-trigger**: Trigger single or batch recovery
- **DELETE /api/queue-recovery/manual-trigger**: Cancel or archive failed jobs

#### Batch Processing Capabilities
```typescript
// Example batch recovery request
{
  "failedJobIds": ["job1", "job2", "job3"],
  "priority": "high",
  "bypassChecks": false,
  "reason": "Manual recovery after system maintenance"
}
```

#### Recovery Response
```typescript
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "requested": 3,
    "queued": 3,
    "failed": 0,
    "results": [
      {
        "failedJobId": "job1",
        "manualJobId": "manual_abc123",
        "status": "queued"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### 5. Monitoring Dashboard Features

#### Real-Time Health Indicators
- **Queue Status**: Healthy/Degraded/Critical/Recovering with color coding
- **Success Rate**: Percentage of successful job completions
- **Recovery Rate**: Percentage of failed jobs successfully recovered
- **Processing Rate**: Jobs processed per minute
- **Jobs Requiring Attention**: Count of manual intervention candidates

#### Interactive Failed Jobs Management
- **Multi-Select Interface**: Checkbox selection for batch operations
- **Job Details Display**: Failure reason, count, strategy, error category
- **Action Buttons**: Individual retry or bulk recovery triggers
- **Filtering Options**: By project, job type, recoverability status
- **Time-Based Information**: Relative timestamps (5m ago, 2h ago, etc.)

#### System Recommendations Engine
```typescript
// Examples of intelligent recommendations
- "High failure count detected - investigate root cause"
- "Circuit breakers in OPEN state - check service health"
- "Dead letter queue accumulating - manual review needed"
- "Error rate above threshold - system capacity issues"
- "Multiple authentication failures - check credentials"
```

## Integration Features

### 1. Seamless Task 4.1 Integration
```typescript
// Queue recovery uses emergency fallback for job recovery
const result = await emergencyFallbackSystem.executeWithFallback(
  () => recoverReportGeneration(failedJob),
  {
    projectId: failedJob.projectId,
    operationType: 'report_generation',
    originalError: new Error(failedJob.failureReason),
    correlationId: failedJob.metadata.correlationId
  }
);
```

### 2. Error Classification Integration
- Uses Task 4.1 error classification for recovery strategy selection
- Inherits circuit breaker state awareness
- Leverages intelligent retry/no-retry decisions
- Integrates with emergency mode activation

### 3. Service Initialization Integration
- Compatible with Task 3.2 consolidated service patterns
- Uses proper cleanup and resource management
- Maintains correlation ID tracking throughout recovery process

## Advanced Features

### 1. Queue Health Monitoring
```typescript
interface QueueHealth {
  status: 'healthy' | 'degraded' | 'critical' | 'recovering';
  activeJobs: number;
  waitingJobs: number;
  failedJobs: number;
  deadLetterJobs: number;
  processingRate: number;
  errorRate: number;
  recommendations: string[];
}
```

### 2. Recovery Statistics Tracking
```typescript
interface RecoveryStats {
  totalJobs: number;
  succeededJobs: number;
  failedJobs: number;
  recoveredJobs: number;
  deadLetterJobs: number;
  manualInterventionRequired: number;
  averageRecoveryTime: number;
  lastRecoveryAt?: Date;
}
```

### 3. Database Persistence
```sql
CREATE TABLE failed_jobs (
  id VARCHAR(255) PRIMARY KEY,
  task_id VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  project_id VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  job_type ENUM('comparative', 'intelligent', 'initial') NOT NULL,
  failure_reason TEXT NOT NULL,
  failure_count INTEGER DEFAULT 1,
  recovery_strategy ENUM('retry', 'manual', 'fallback', 'dead_letter'),
  metadata JSON,
  original_job_data JSON,
  INDEX idx_project_job_type (project_id, job_type),
  INDEX idx_recovery_strategy (recovery_strategy)
);
```
