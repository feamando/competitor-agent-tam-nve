## 🔒 **Backup Safety**

Two comprehensive backups created:
- **Initial Migration:** `backups/documentation-migration-20250801_103849/`
- **Remaining Files:** `backups/remaining-docs-migration-20250801_104711/`

## 🔢 **Current Document Numbering Status**

Ready for future documentation:
- **Next Task Plan:** TP-013
- **Next Completion Report:** CR-114
- **Next Strategy Document:** S-017  
- **Next Thought Process:** TH-006
- **Next Documentation:** D-020

## ✅ **Verification Results**

- **✅ `/docs` directory:** 0 remaining markdown files
- **✅ Root level:** Only essential files remain (README.md)
- **✅ Total organized:** 193 files in standardized structure
- **✅ Naming convention:** 100% compliance with `[[type]]-[[number]]-[[date]]-[[name]]`
