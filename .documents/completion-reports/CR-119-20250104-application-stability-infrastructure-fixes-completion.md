## Technical Implementation Details

### Database Layer Fixes
**Files Modified:**
- `jest.setup.js` - Added comprehensive Prisma model mocks with proper return values
- All Prisma models now include: `create`, `findMany`, `findUnique`, `findFirst`, `update`, `upsert`, `delete`, `deleteMany`, `count`

**Key Code Changes:**
```javascript
// Added missing upsert method and return values
project: {
  create: jest.fn().mockResolvedValue({ id: '1', name: 'Test Project', status: 'ACTIVE' }),
  findMany: jest.fn().mockResolvedValue([]),
  upsert: jest.fn().mockResolvedValue({ id: '1', name: 'Upserted Project' }),
  // ... other CRUD methods
},
```

### Service Infrastructure Fixes
**Files Modified:**
- `src/services/serviceRegistry.ts` - Fixed dependency injection system
- `src/services/domains/reporting/ReportProcessor.ts` - Added defensive queue checks
- `src/services/domains/reporting/ReportGenerator.ts` - Added config guards
- Multiple service files - Added defensive property access patterns

**Key Architectural Fix:**
```typescript
// Before: Services created without dependencies
const service = new serviceClass();

// After: Services created with proper dependency injection  
const dependencyInstances = await this.resolveDependencies(serviceName);
const service = new serviceClass(...dependencyInstances);
```

### Next.js API Route Fixes
**Files Modified:**
- `jest.setup.js` - Added Request/Response polyfills
- API route test files - Updated to use proper NextResponse patterns

**Critical Polyfill Implementation:**
```javascript
global.Request = class MockRequest {
  constructor(input, init = {}) {
    this.url = typeof input === 'string' ? input : input.url;
    this.method = init?.method || 'GET';
  }
};

global.Response = class MockResponse {
  static json(data, init = {}) {
    return new this(JSON.stringify(data), { 
      ...init, 
      headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json', ...(init.headers || {}) }
    });
  }
};
```

## Remaining Work & Recommendations

### What Was **NOT** Addressed (By Design)
This task plan specifically focused on **infrastructure issues only**. The following were intentionally excluded:

1. **Business Logic Gaps:** Service implementation completeness (e.g., missing AIAnalyzer)
2. **Test Data Issues:** Insufficient or malformed mock data in tests
3. **API Response Mismatches:** Expected vs. actual response structure differences
4. **Obsolete Test Updates:** Legacy tests requiring updates for new architecture

### Follow-Up Recommendations
1. **Service Implementation Completion:** Address missing business logic components
2. **Test Data Strategy:** Implement comprehensive mock data factory
3. **API Contract Validation:** Align API responses with frontend expectations
4. **Test Suite Modernization:** Update obsolete tests to match current architecture
