- **Integration:** Seamless wizard component integration
- **Routing:** Enhanced navigation logic for post-creation flows
- **Error Handling:** Improved error boundary configuration

### **Key Implementation Features**

#### **Simplified State Management**
```typescript
// BEFORE: Complex phase-based state
interface ProjectCreationState {
  phase: 'form' | 'creating' | 'generating_report' | 'completed' | 'error';
  projectId?: string;
  error?: string;
  reportGenerationInfo?: { ... };
}

// AFTER: Minimal state for navigation
const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState(false);
```

#### **Smart Draft Recovery**
- Automatic detection of interrupted project creation sessions
- Safe JSON parsing with error recovery
- Automatic cleanup after successful loading

#### **Enhanced Routing Logic**
- Report-first navigation when reports are generated
- Project navigation fallback for non-report projects
- Proper loading states during navigation

#### **Improved Error Boundary Integration**
- Correct context properties for error tracking
- Enhanced error reporting for monitoring services
- Development-friendly error details

### **Preserved Functionality**
- ✅ **Project Creation API:** Full compatibility with existing `/api/projects` endpoint
- ✅ **Error Handling:** Enhanced error recovery and user feedback
- ✅ **Navigation:** Intelligent routing based on project creation outcomes
- ✅ **Progress Tracking:** Superior real-time progress with SSE integration
- ✅ **Draft Support:** Automatic draft saving and recovery

## 🎯 User Experience Improvements
