## Implementation Guidelines

### Key Approaches
- **Defensive Programming:** Add validation at every step of the data pipeline
- **Circuit Breaker Pattern:** Implement circuit breakers for external service calls
- **Graceful Degradation:** Create multiple fallback levels instead of binary failure
- **Monitoring-First:** Add monitoring before implementing fixes

### Existing Code References
- **Emergency System:** `src/lib/emergency-fallback/EmergencyFallbackSystem.ts`
- **Data Collection:** `src/services/reports/smartDataCollectionService.ts`
- **Product Scraping:** `src/services/productScrapingService.ts`
- **Cron Jobs:** `src/services/comparativeReportScheduler.ts`
- **Report Generation:** `src/services/reports/initialComparativeReportService.ts`

### Technical Patterns
- Use existing correlation ID system for tracking data pipeline issues
- Leverage current monitoring infrastructure in `src/lib/monitoring/`
- Implement atomic operations using Prisma transactions
- Use existing retry mechanisms from queue recovery system

## Edge Cases & Error Handling

### Data Collection Edge Cases
- **Network Failures:** Implement exponential backoff for web scraping failures
- **Partial Data:** Handle scenarios where some but not all competitor data is available
- **Stale Data:** Define acceptable data age thresholds for different report types
- **Concurrent Access:** Handle multiple report generations accessing same data sources

### System Recovery Edge Cases
- **Database Connection Loss:** Implement connection retry with circuit breaker
- **Memory Exhaustion:** Add memory usage monitoring for data-intensive operations
- **Disk Space Issues:** Monitor and clean up temporary data files
- **Service Dependencies:** Handle upstream service failures gracefully

### Error Handling Strategies
- **Structured Logging:** Use correlation IDs for tracing issues across services
- **Error Classification:** Categorize errors by severity and recovery strategy
- **User Communication:** Provide clear status updates during system recovery
- **Automated Recovery:** Implement self-healing for common failure patterns

## Code Review Guidelines

### Data Pipeline Reviews
- **Data Validation:** Ensure all data inputs are validated before processing
- **Transaction Safety:** Verify database operations use proper transactions
- **Resource Cleanup:** Check for proper cleanup of temporary resources
- **Error Propagation:** Ensure errors are properly logged and propagated

### System Health Reviews
- **Monitoring Coverage:** Verify all critical paths have monitoring
- **Alert Thresholds:** Review alert thresholds for false positive rates
- **Recovery Testing:** Ensure recovery mechanisms are tested and functional
- **Performance Impact:** Check monitoring overhead on system performance
