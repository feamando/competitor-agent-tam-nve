## Implementation Guidelines

### Service Consolidation Approach
- **Pattern**: Domain-Driven Design with clear boundaries
- **Reference**: Current services in `src/services/` directory
- **Approach**: Gradual consolidation with feature flags for rollback
- **Example Pattern**:
```typescript
// Before: Multiple services
SmartAIService, SmartSchedulingService, IntelligentReportingService

// After: Unified domain service
class AnalysisService {
  private aiProcessor: AIProcessor;
  private scheduler: SmartScheduler;
  private reportingEngine: ReportingEngine;
}
```

### Database Migration Strategy
- **Pattern**: Incremental schema migrations with rollback support
- **Reference**: `prisma/schema.prisma` and `prisma/migrations/`
- **Approach**: Blue-green deployment strategy for zero-downtime updates
- **Validation**: Comprehensive data integrity checks before and after migration

### Test Architecture Simplification
- **Pattern**: Domain-based test organization with shared fixtures
- **Reference**: Current test files in `src/__tests__/`
- **Approach**: Consolidate mocks to match new service architecture
- **Quality Gate**: 90%+ pass rate before any production deployment

## Proposed File Structure

### New Service Organization
```

â”œâ”€â”€ domains/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ DataService.ts          # Consolidated data operations
