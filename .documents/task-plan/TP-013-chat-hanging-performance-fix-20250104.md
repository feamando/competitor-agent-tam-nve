# Task Plan: Chat Hanging Performance Fix

## Overview

**Project Name:** Competitor Research Agent  
**Date:** January 4, 2025  
**RequestID:** TP-013  
**Goal:** Fix the chat hanging issue occurring at first step initialization that causes 4.7+ second delays and potential timeouts

**Problem Description:**
The chat interface is experiencing hanging behavior during the first step of user interaction. Terminal logs show the request takes 4728ms for GET /chat, indicating performance bottlenecks in the initialization flow. The issue appears to be related to AWS service status checks and Bedrock service initialization during chat startup.

## Pre-requisites

- Local development environment running (Node.js, Next.js)
- Access to AWS credentials for testing
- Git access to feature branch
- **Git Branch Creation:** `git checkout -b feature/chat-hanging-performance-fix-20250104-TP-013`

## Dependencies

- AWS Bedrock service configuration
- AWS credential management system
- Next.js API route handling 
- Chat conversation management system
- Frontend loading state management

    - [ ] 3.1 Add graceful degradation when AWS services timeout
    - [ ] 3.2 Implement proper error messaging for service unavailability
    - [ ] 3.3 Add fallback chat functionality without AWS dependencies
    - [ ] 3.4 Enhance logging for debugging timeout issues

- [ ] 4.0 Frontend Loading State Improvements
    - [ ] 4.1 Add loading indicators during chat initialization
    - [ ] 4.2 Implement timeout warnings after 3 seconds
    - [ ] 4.3 Add retry functionality for failed initialization
    - [ ] 4.4 Improve user feedback during service startup

- [ ] 5.0 Testing and Verification
    - [ ] 5.1 Create test cases for AWS service timeout scenarios
    - [ ] 5.2 Test chat functionality with and without AWS services
    - [ ] 5.3 Verify initialization time is under 2 seconds
    - [ ] 5.4 Test error handling and recovery flows

- [ ] 6.0 Documentation and Monitoring
    - [ ] 6.1 Document timeout configuration changes
    - [ ] 6.2 Add performance monitoring for chat initialization
    - [ ] 6.3 Create runbook for chat hanging issues
    - [ ] 6.4 Update error handling documentation

## Implementation Guidelines

### Timeout Configuration Strategy
- Implement cascading timeouts: 1.5s for AWS check, 3s total for chat init
- Use Promise.race() for timeout enforcement  
- Add circuit breaker after 3 consecutive failures

### Error Handling Patterns
- Always provide fallback functionality when AWS services fail
- Use structured error logging with correlation IDs
- Implement user-friendly error messages that don't expose internal details

### Performance Optimization
- Cache AWS status results for 2 minutes to avoid repeated checks
- Use async/await with proper timeout handling
- Implement lazy loading for non-critical services

### Key Files to Modify
- `src/lib/chat/awsStatusChecker.ts` - Primary timeout fixes
- `src/lib/chat/conversation.ts` - Error handling improvements  
- `src/hooks/useChat.ts` - Frontend loading states
- `src/app/api/chat/route.ts` - API timeout handling

## Proposed File Structure

```
src/lib/chat/
├── awsStatusChecker.ts (MODIFY - reduce timeouts)
├── conversation.ts (MODIFY - add fallback handling)
└── chatPerformanceMonitor.ts (NEW - monitoring)

src/components/chat/
├── ChatInterface.tsx (MODIFY - loading states)
└── ChatErrorBoundary.tsx (NEW - error handling)
```

## Edge Cases & Error Handling

### Timeout Scenarios
- AWS credential expiration during chat session
- Network connectivity issues
- Bedrock service regional unavailability
- Database connection timeouts

### Error Recovery Strategies  
- Graceful degradation to basic chat functionality
- Automatic retry with exponential backoff
- User notification with retry options
- Session state preservation during failures

### Performance Edge Cases
- High concurrent user load
- Cold start delays in serverless environment
- Memory constraints during initialization

## Code Review Guidelines

- Verify all timeout values are configurable via environment variables
- Ensure error messages are user-friendly and don't expose internal details
- Check that fallback functionality works without AWS dependencies
- Validate that logging provides sufficient debugging information
- Confirm performance improvements through load testing

## Acceptance Testing Checklist

### Functional Requirements
- [ ] Chat initializes within 2 seconds under normal conditions
- [ ] Chat provides fallback functionality when AWS services are unavailable
- [ ] Error messages are clear and actionable for users
- [ ] Loading indicators appear within 500ms of user interaction
- [ ] Retry functionality works correctly after failures

### Performance Requirements  
- [ ] Initial chat load time < 2 seconds (95th percentile)
- [ ] AWS status check timeout < 1.5 seconds
- [ ] No memory leaks during extended chat sessions
- [ ] Concurrent user handling without degradation

### Error Handling Requirements
- [ ] Graceful handling of AWS credential expiration
- [ ] Proper error recovery without page refresh
- [ ] Appropriate logging for debugging purposes
- [ ] User feedback during service interruptions

## Notes / Open Questions

- Consider implementing WebSocket connections for real-time status updates
- Evaluate need for server-side caching of AWS service status
- Assess impact of reducing timeout values on AWS service reliability
- Review if chat functionality can operate entirely offline as fallback
