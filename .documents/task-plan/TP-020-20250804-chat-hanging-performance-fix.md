# Task Plan: Fix Chat Hanging Issue - Performance Optimization

## Overview
**Project Name:** competitor-research-agent  
**Date:** 2025-08-04  
**RequestID:** TP-020-20250804-chat-hanging-performance-fix  

**Goal:** Fix the chat hanging issue at the first step, caused by excessive AWS health checks leading to rate limiting and performance degradation.

## Root Cause Analysis

Based on log analysis and symptoms:

1. **Primary Issue:** Chat hangs at first step despite no visible terminal errors
2. **AWS Health Check Spam:** Repeated GET `/api/health/aws` requests (401/429 responses)
3. **Rate Limiting:** 429 responses indicate AWS health endpoint is being hit too frequently
4. **Compilation Loop:** Chat API keeps recompiling, suggesting hot reload cycles
5. **Performance Impact:** AWS status checker may be called synchronously, blocking chat flow

**Error Pattern:**
```
Multiple GET /api/health/aws 401/429 responses
Chat compilation loop
User experiences hanging at first step
```

## Implementation Guidelines

### Key Approaches
1. **Non-blocking Operations:** Make AWS checks asynchronous and non-blocking
2. **Circuit Breaker Pattern:** Prevent cascading failures from AWS issues
3. **Performance First:** Prioritize chat responsiveness over AWS status accuracy
4. **Graceful Degradation:** Allow chat to work even with AWS status unknown

### Reference Files
- `src/lib/chat/awsStatusChecker.ts` (Needs performance optimization)
- `src/lib/chat/conversation.ts` (AWS status integration)
- `src/app/api/chat/route.ts` (Error handling)

### Implementation Examples
```typescript
// Example: Non-blocking AWS status check
async checkAWSStatusNonBlocking(): Promise<AWSStatusResult> {
  // Return cached result immediately if available
  if (this.lastResult && this.isCacheValid()) {
    return this.lastResult;
  }
  
  // Start async check but don't wait for it
  this.performAsyncStatusCheck().catch(err => {
    console.warn('Background AWS status check failed:', err);
  });
  
  // Return last known status or safe default
  return this.lastResult || this.getDefaultSafeStatus();
}
```

### Performance Considerations
- AWS status checks should not block chat initialization
- Cache duration should be long enough to prevent rate limiting
- Implement progressive timeouts (fast fail for user experience)
- Use background refresh for status updates

## Proposed File Structure

**Modified Files:**
- `src/lib/chat/awsStatusChecker.ts` (Performance optimization)
- `src/lib/chat/conversation.ts` (Non-blocking integration)
- `src/app/api/chat/route.ts` (Timeout handling)

**New Files:**
- `src/lib/performance/chatPerformanceMonitor.ts`
- `src/constants/performanceConfig.ts`

## Edge Cases & Error Handling

**Edge Cases:**
1. AWS health check takes longer than chat timeout
2. Multiple simultaneous chat requests triggering AWS checks
3. Browser tab switching causing status check interruptions
4. Network connectivity issues during status checks

**Error Handling Strategies:**
- Implement fast-fail timeouts (2-3 seconds max)
- Use exponential backoff for repeated failures
- Provide immediate fallback responses
- Log performance metrics for monitoring

## Code Review Guidelines

**Focus Areas:**
1. Verify AWS status checks are truly non-blocking
2. Ensure cache invalidation doesn't cause performance issues
3. Check that error handling doesn't trigger compilation loops
4. Validate timeout values are appropriate for user experience
5. Review logging doesn't impact performance

## Acceptance Testing Checklist

**Functional Checks:**
- [ ] Chat responds immediately at first step (under 2 seconds)
- [ ] AWS status checks don't block chat initialization
- [ ] Rate limiting doesn't occur during normal usage
- [ ] Chat works correctly when AWS is completely unavailable
- [ ] No compilation loops during chat usage
- [ ] Error handling provides immediate feedback

**Performance Checks:**
- [ ] Chat initialization time under 2 seconds
- [ ] AWS status check doesn't exceed 3 second timeout
- [ ] No excessive API calls to AWS health endpoint
- [ ] Memory usage remains stable during extended chat usage
- [ ] CPU usage doesn't spike during AWS status checks

## Notes / Open Questions

1. **Cache Strategy:** Should we cache AWS status globally or per chat session?
2. **User Feedback:** How should we indicate when AWS services are being checked?
3. **Monitoring:** What metrics should we track for chat performance?
4. **Fallback Duration:** How long should we wait before falling back to non-AWS mode?

## Risk Assessment

**High Risk:**
- Performance changes could affect other parts of the application
- Cache invalidation logic could cause race conditions

**Medium Risk:**
- Timeout values might not be optimal for all network conditions
- Background AWS checks could accumulate and cause memory issues

**Low Risk:**
- Logging additions for performance monitoring
- Configuration parameter adjustments

## Success Metrics

- Chat initialization time: Under 2 seconds consistently
- AWS health check rate: Maximum 1 request per 30 seconds per session
- User-reported hanging issues: Reduce to zero
- Chat response time: Under 3 seconds for first interaction
- System stability: No compilation loops or hot reload issues
