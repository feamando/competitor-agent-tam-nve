## Implementation Guidelines

### Key Approaches and Patterns
* **Component Pattern:** Follow existing functional component patterns with hooks
* **API Integration:** Use existing fetch patterns with proper error handling
* **State Management:** Utilize React hooks (useState, useEffect) for component state
* **Error Handling:** Implement try-catch blocks with user-friendly error messages
* **Accessibility:** Include proper ARIA labels and keyboard navigation support

### Reference Existing Code Sections
* **API Patterns:** `/src/app/api/competitors/route.ts` for request/response handling
* **Component Patterns:** `/src/components/competitors/` for existing component structure
* **Hook Patterns:** `/src/hooks/` for custom hook implementations
* **Test Patterns:** `/src/__tests__/components/` for component testing approaches

### Technical Considerations
* **Performance:** Minimal impact as delete is infrequent operation
* **Security:** Rely on existing API authentication and authorization
* **Scalability:** Component should be reusable across different entity types
* **User Experience:** Clear confirmation flow to prevent accidental deletions

## Proposed File Structure

### New Files to Create
```
src/components/competitors/
â”œâ”€â”€ DeleteCompetitorButton.tsx          # Main delete button component
â””â”€â”€ __tests__/
    â””â”€â”€ DeleteCompetitorButton.test.tsx # Unit tests

src/hooks/
â”œâ”€â”€ useDeleteCompetitor.ts              # Custom hook for delete API
â””â”€â”€ __tests__/
    â””â”€â”€ useDeleteCompetitor.test.ts     # Hook unit tests

src/__tests__/integration/
â””â”€â”€ competitorDeletion.test.ts          # Integration tests
```

### Files to Modify
```
src/app/competitors/[id]/page.tsx       # Add delete button to detail page
src/components/ui/                      # Add confirmation dialog if not exists
```

## Edge Cases & Error Handling

### Potential Edge Cases
* **Competitor Not Found:** Handle 404 responses gracefully
* **Network Failures:** Provide retry mechanism or clear error messaging
* **Concurrent Deletion:** Handle cases where competitor is deleted by another user
* **Related Data Dependencies:** Ensure proper cascading delete messaging
* **Browser Navigation:** Handle browser back/forward during deletion process

### Error Handling Strategies
* **API Errors:** Display user-friendly error messages with correlation IDs
* **Network Issues:** Show loading states and retry options
* **Permission Errors:** Clear messaging about insufficient permissions
* **Logging:** Utilize existing correlation tracking for error diagnosis

## Code Review Guidelines

### Focus Areas for Reviewers
* **Component Architecture:** Ensure reusability and proper separation of concerns
* **Error Handling:** Verify comprehensive error scenarios are covered
* **User Experience:** Confirm confirmation flow is intuitive and safe
* **Test Coverage:** Ensure both happy path and error scenarios are tested
* **Performance:** Verify no unnecessary re-renders or API calls
* **Accessibility:** Check ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, and screen reader support
* **Security:** Confirm no client-side security bypasses

## Notes / Open Questions

### Implementation Notes
* Consider adding bulk delete functionality in future iterations
* Monitor delete operation frequency for potential performance optimization needs
* Evaluate need for soft delete vs hard delete based on business requirements

### Future Enhancements
