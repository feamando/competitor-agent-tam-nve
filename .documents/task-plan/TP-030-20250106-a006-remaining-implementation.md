## Edge Cases & Error Handling

### Service Degradation Scenarios
- **Complete Bedrock Unavailability:** Queue all requests, notify users of delays
- **Partial Service Degradation:** Implement hybrid processing with quality indicators
- **Intermittent Failures:** Smart retry with progressive backoff
- **Timeout Scenarios:** Graceful fallback with user notification options

### User Experience Edge Cases
- **Multiple Concurrent Reports:** Priority queue management and resource allocation
- **Service Recovery During Processing:** Seamless transition from fallback to full service
- **Network Connectivity Issues:** Offline-friendly messaging and retry prompts
- **Browser Session Management:** Persistent notification states across sessions

### Error Handling Strategies
1. **Graceful Degradation:** Always provide some level of service
2. **Transparent Communication:** Clear, non-technical error explanations
3. **Recovery Assistance:** Actionable steps for users during service issues
4. **Automatic Remediation:** Self-healing systems where possible

## Code Review Guidelines

### Critical Review Points
1. **User Experience Consistency:** Ensure all service states have appropriate user feedback
2. **Error Message Clarity:** Verify all user-facing messages are helpful and actionable
3. **Performance Impact:** Review retry mechanisms for potential performance bottlenecks
4. **Resource Management:** Validate queue processing doesn't overwhelm system resources
5. **Security Considerations:** Ensure admin dashboard access controls are properly implemented

### Quality Assurance Focus
- **Cross-browser Compatibility:** Test notification systems across different browsers
- **Mobile Responsiveness:** Verify dashboard and notification components work on mobile
- **Accessibility Compliance:** Ensure all new components meet accessibility standards
- **Performance Monitoring:** Validate new monitoring doesn't impact application performance
