# Task Plan: Zombie Report Fix

## Overview
Fix critical "zombie report" issue where emergency fallback reports are created without ReportVersion content, making them unviewable despite showing as COMPLETED. Address both the SmartDataCollectionService root cause and the emergency fallback bug.

## Implementation Guidelines

### Key Technical Approaches:
1. **Immediate Triage**: Fix existing zombie reports first to restore user access
2. **Root Cause Resolution**: Address SmartDataCollectionService error causing fallback triggers
3. **Fallback Completeness**: Ensure emergency reports are fully functional, not partial
4. **Transaction Safety**: Use database transactions for atomic Report+ReportVersion creation
5. **Error Resilience**: Add comprehensive error handling and monitoring

### Reference Existing Modules:
- **Emergency Report Logic:** `src/services/reports/initialComparativeReportService.ts` lines 637-729
- **Report Saving Pattern:** `src/lib/reports.ts` lines 547-587 for proper ReportVersion creation
- **Database Operations:** Use Prisma transactions for atomic operations
- **Error Handling:** Follow existing correlation ID and logging patterns

### Implementation Examples:

**Fixed Emergency Fallback Pattern:**
```typescript
// In generateEmergencyFallbackReport, replace lines 706-716:
const result = await prisma.$transaction(async (tx) => {
  const savedReport = await tx.report.create({
    data: {
      id: fallbackReport.id,
      name: fallbackReport.title,
      description: 'Emergency fallback report',
      projectId: projectId,
      competitorId: project.competitors?.[0]?.id || '',
      status: 'COMPLETED'
    }
  });

  await tx.reportVersion.create({
    data: {
      reportId: fallbackReport.id,
      version: 1,
      content: fallbackReport as any,
    },
  });

  return savedReport;
});
```

**Zombie Report Detection Query:**
```typescript
const zombieReports = await prisma.report.findMany({
  where: {
    status: 'COMPLETED',
    versions: { none: {} }
  },
  include: { project: true }
});
```

### Performance Considerations:
- Zombie report detection should run as background job, not blocking user operations
- Report generation fixes should not impact existing working reports
- Emergency fallback should remain fast while being complete
- Migration scripts should process reports in batches to avoid memory issues

## Proposed File Structure

### New Files:
```
scripts/
├── fix-zombie-reports.ts                    # Migration script for existing zombie reports
├── detect-zombie-reports.ts                 # Detection and monitoring script
└── validate-report-integrity.ts             # Validation utility

src/lib/
└── reportValidation.ts                      # Report integrity validation utilities

src/__tests__/
├── integration/
│   └── zombieReportFix.test.ts             # Integration tests for fixes
└── unit/
    └── emergencyFallbackReport.test.ts     # Unit tests for emergency fallback
```

### Modified Files:
```
src/services/reports/initialComparativeReportService.ts  # Fix emergency fallback
src/services/reports/smartDataCollectionService.ts      # Fix root cause error
src/lib/monitoring/reportHealthCheck.ts                 # Add zombie detection
```

## Edge Cases & Error Handling

### Critical Edge Cases:
1. **Concurrent Report Generation:** Multiple emergency reports for same project
2. **Partial Migration Failures:** Some zombie reports fixed, others remain
3. **Database Transaction Failures:** Report created but ReportVersion fails
4. **Content Generation Errors:** Emergency content creation fails
5. **Legacy Report Compatibility:** Existing reports with different content structure

### Error Handling Strategy:
- **Atomic Operations:** Use database transactions for Report+ReportVersion creation
- **Rollback Capability:** Ensure all migrations can be safely rolled back
- **Graceful Degradation:** If ReportVersion creation fails, delete the Report record
- **Comprehensive Logging:** Track all zombie report detection and fixing operations
- **Monitoring Integration:** Alert on any new zombie reports appearing

## Code Review Guidelines

### Primary Review Focus Areas:
1. **Database Consistency:** Ensure Report and ReportVersion are always created together
2. **Transaction Safety:** Verify atomic operations prevent partial record creation
3. **Error Handling:** Confirm all failure scenarios are properly handled
4. **Backward Compatibility:** Ensure existing reports continue working
5. **Performance Impact:** Validate fixes don't degrade report generation performance
6. **Migration Safety:** Review zombie report migration for data integrity

### Specific Review Checkpoints:
- [ ] Emergency fallback creates both Report and ReportVersion atomically
- [ ] SmartDataCollectionService error handling prevents cascade failures
- [ ] Zombie report detection accurately identifies incomplete reports
- [ ] Migration scripts include proper rollback procedures
- [ ] All report generation paths include ReportVersion validation
- [ ] Error monitoring captures zombie report creation events
