## Implementation Guidelines

### Key Approaches
- **Service Integration Pattern:** Use dependency injection and service initialization similar to existing report services
- **Error Handling Strategy:** Implement comprehensive try-catch blocks with specific error types and fallback mechanisms
- **Performance Optimization:** Set reasonable timeouts and use async/await patterns consistently
- **Data Quality Management:** Implement scoring system for data completeness and quality assessment

### Reference Code Sections
- `src/services/domains/reporting/ReportGenerator.ts` line 75+ - `generateComparativeReport()` method pattern
- `src/services/reports/initialComparativeReportService.ts` line 325+ - Data validation and service orchestration
- `src/services/bedrock/bedrock.service.ts` - AWS Bedrock service usage patterns
- `src/services/domains/reporting/ReportProcessor.ts` - Report processing and persistence patterns

### Code Structure Example
```typescript
async generateInitialReport(request: InitialReportRequest): Promise<InitialReportResponse> {
  const correlationId = generateCorrelationId();
  const startTime = Date.now();
  
  try {
    // 1. Validate input and fetch project data
    // 2. Initialize required services (BedrockService, analyzers)
    // 3. Collect and analyze competitor data using analysis services
    // 4. Generate comprehensive report using template system
    // 5. Persist to database and file system
    // 6. Return success response with metadata
  } catch (error) {
    // Handle errors gracefully with proper logging
  }
}
```
