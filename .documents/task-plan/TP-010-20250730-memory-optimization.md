## Implementation Guidelines

### Key Technologies & Patterns:
- **Memory Management:** Use WeakMap/WeakSet for temporary object references
- **Streaming Processing:** Replace large JSON operations with stream-based processing
- **Queue Implementation:** Utilize p-queue library for robust request queuing
- **Cleanup Patterns:** Implement disposable pattern with explicit resource cleanup

### Critical Code Locations:
- `src/services/bedrock/bedrock.service.ts` - AI service memory management
- `src/lib/reports.ts` - Report generation optimization
- `src/lib/chat/conversation.ts` - Chat state management
- `src/lib/monitoring/ComprehensiveMemoryMonitor.ts` - Memory monitoring enhancements

### Performance Considerations:
- Target <400MB heap usage for normal operations
- Keep AI request processing under 30 seconds
- Maintain garbage collection frequency below 10/minute
- Ensure system memory stays below 85% under normal load

## Edge Cases & Error Handling

### Memory Pressure Scenarios:
- **Queue Overflow:** Reject new requests with 503 Service Unavailable
- **Analysis Timeout:** Clean up partial results and notify user
- **Service Degradation:** Disable advanced features, maintain core functionality
- **Critical Memory:** Force restart mechanism with graceful connection handling

### Error Recovery Strategies:
- Implement exponential backoff for failed cleanup operations
- Add fallback mechanisms for AI service failures
- Provide partial results when full analysis cannot complete
- Log all memory-related errors with correlation IDs for debugging

## Code Review Guidelines

### Critical Review Points:
- **Memory Cleanup:** Verify all large objects are explicitly nullified after use
- **Queue Implementation:** Ensure proper error handling and timeout management
- **Resource Disposal:** Check that all services implement proper cleanup methods
- **Performance Impact:** Validate that optimizations don't degrade analysis quality
- **Error Handling:** Confirm graceful degradation under memory pressure

### Testing Requirements:
- Memory leak detection using heap snapshots
- Load testing with concurrent analysis requests  
- Stress testing under various memory pressure scenarios
- Validation of analysis result quality after optimizations

## Acceptance Testing Checklist

- [ ] System memory usage stays below 85% during normal operations
- [ ] Heap usage remains under 400MB for typical analysis workflows
- [ ] AI analysis requests complete within 30-second timeout
- [ ] Chat conversations maintain history without memory leaks
- [ ] Report generation handles multiple competitors without crashes

### Performance Requirements:
- [ ] Garbage collection frequency reduced to <10 cycles/minute

## Notes / Open Questions

### Future Improvements:
- Consider implementing Redis-based conversation storage for horizontal scaling
- Evaluate migrating to streaming AI responses for large analyses
- Assess feasibility of background processing for non-urgent reports
- Review potential for database query optimization to reduce memory usage

### Technical Debt:
- Legacy JSON stringification patterns throughout codebase need systematic replacement
- Memory monitoring system could benefit from integration with external APM tools
- Consider implementing memory usage budgets per user/tenant for multi-tenancy support

### Risk Mitigation:
- Implement feature flags for new memory management features
- Plan rollback strategy if optimizations negatively impact functionality
- Consider gradual rollout with A/B testing for production deployment
- Ensure monitoring systems can detect regression in memory usage patterns
