# Task Plan: Report Data Collection and Aggregation Fix

## Overview
- **Project Name:** Competitor Research Agent
- **Task Name:** Report Data Collection and Aggregation Fix
- **Date:** 2025-08-05
- **RequestID:** TP-025-20250805-report-data-collection-aggregation-fix

**Goal:** Fix the root cause preventing full comparative report generation by resolving data collection and aggregation failures in the InitialComparativeReportService that result in emergency fallback reports instead of proper AI-powered comparative analyses.

## Problem Statement
Investigation of project `cmdykesxt000jl81e01j69soo` revealed that despite successful data collection (5 competitor snapshots + 1 product snapshot), the report generation system fails to properly aggregate competitor data, resulting in:
- Emergency fallback reports instead of full comparative analysis
- `competitorSnapshotsCaptured: 0` despite existing snapshots
- Reports marked as `INDIVIDUAL` instead of `COMPARATIVE`
- Reports not flagged as `isInitialReport: true`
- No AI/Bedrock analysis performed

## Pre-requisites
- Access to the codebase and database
- Understanding of the InitialComparativeReportService data flow
- **Git Branch Creation:** `git checkout -b feature/report-data-collection-fix-20250805-TP025`

## Dependencies
- **Core Service:** `InitialComparativeReportService` (primary focus)
- **Data Collection:** `SmartDataCollectionService` (likely issue source)
- **Database Models:** Project, Report, Competitor, Snapshot relationships
- **Dependencies:** Prisma ORM for data queries

## Task Breakdown

## Implementation Guidelines (Updated Based on Root Cause Analysis)

### Key Focus Areas
1. **Interface Definition:** Add missing `capturedCount` field to `SmartDataCollectionResult`
2. **Data Aggregation:** Calculate and include `capturedCount` in result object
3. **Single File Fix:** Primary changes in `src/services/reports/smartDataCollectionService.ts`
4. **Minimal Scope:** No database queries or complex logic changes needed

### Critical Code Sections (Identified)
- `SmartDataCollectionResult` interface (lines 15-23) - ADD `capturedCount` field
- Result object creation (lines 123-131) - ADD `capturedCount` calculation
- No other files require changes for core fix

### Implementation Approach (Refined)
1. **Minimal Changes:** Single field addition, no architectural changes
2. **No New Services:** Work within existing `SmartDataCollectionService`
3. **Simple Calculation:** `capturedCount = freshSnapshots + existingSnapshots`
4. **Zero Risk:** No database queries or complex logic modifications needed

## Proposed File Structure (Updated)
**Files to Modify:**
- `src/services/reports/smartDataCollectionService.ts` (ONLY file requiring changes)
  - Interface definition (lines 15-23)
  - Result object creation (lines 123-131)

**Files NOT Requiring Changes:**
- `src/services/reports/initialComparativeReportService.ts` (already correctly expects `capturedCount`)
- No database query modifications needed
- No API contract changes required

## Edge Cases & Error Handling
1. **Missing Competitor Snapshots:** Ensure graceful handling when some competitors lack snapshots
2. **Data Timing Issues:** Handle race conditions in data collection
3. **Partial Data Scenarios:** Maintain existing fallback mechanisms while fixing the core issue
4. **Query Performance:** Ensure data collection fixes don't impact performance

## Code Review Guidelines
- **Focus on Data Flow:** Verify competitor data flows correctly through the pipeline
- **Query Optimization:** Ensure database queries are efficient and return expected data
- **Error Handling:** Maintain existing error handling while fixing the core issue
- **Logging:** Verify adequate logging for debugging future issues
- **Performance:** Ensure no performance degradation in report generation

## Acceptance Testing Checklist
