## Implementation Guidelines

### Key Technical Approaches:
1. **Database Query Optimization:** Use Prisma's `findMany` with proper indexing on `_CompetitorToProject` junction table
2. **Caching Strategy:** Implement Redis-based caching for project-competitor mappings to reduce database load
3. **Error Handling Pattern:** Use consistent error response format with correlation IDs for debugging
4. **Migration Safety:** All database updates should be transactional with rollback capability

### Reference Existing Modules:
- **Project Operations:** `src/services/projectService.ts` for CRUD patterns
- **Report Generation:** `src/lib/reports.ts` for database save patterns  
- **Database Queries:** `src/services/domains/AnalysisService.ts` for Prisma query examples
- **API Error Handling:** `src/lib/utils/errorHandler.ts` for consistent error responses

### Implementation Examples:

**Project Discovery Query:**
```typescript
// Conceptual example - implement in ProjectDiscoveryService
const projects = await prisma.project.findMany({
  where: {
    competitors: {
      some: { id: competitorId }
    }
  },
  select: { id: true, name: true, status: true }
});
```

**API Integration Pattern:**
```typescript
// In /api/reports/generate route
const projectId = options?.projectId || 
  await projectDiscovery.resolveProjectId(competitorId);
```

### Performance Considerations:
- Project lookups should complete within 50ms
- Implement database connection pooling for concurrent requests
- Consider read replicas for project discovery queries
- Add query result caching with 5-minute TTL

## Proposed File Structure

### New Files:
```
src/services/
├── projectDiscoveryService.ts          # Core project resolution logic
└── __tests__/
    └── projectDiscoveryService.test.ts # Unit tests

scripts/
├── fix-orphaned-reports.ts             # Migration script
└── validate-project-associations.ts    # Validation utility

docs/
└── api/
    └── project-report-association.md   # Updated API documentation
```

### Modified Files:
```
src/app/api/reports/generate/route.ts   # Enhanced endpoint
src/lib/reports.ts                      # Updated ReportGenerator
src/lib/chat/conversation.ts            # Fixed project creation
src/services/projectService.ts          # Added discovery methods
```

## Edge Cases & Error Handling

### Critical Edge Cases:
1. **No Project Association:** Competitor exists but belongs to no projects
2. **Multiple Projects:** Competitor belongs to multiple active projects  
3. **Inactive Projects:** Competitor belongs only to archived/inactive projects
4. **Invalid Competitor:** CompetitorId doesn't exist in database
5. **Database Connection Issues:** Temporary database unavailability

### Error Handling Strategy:
- **Graceful Degradation:** If auto-resolution fails, require explicit projectId
- **Detailed Logging:** Log all project resolution attempts with correlation IDs
- **User-Friendly Messages:** Provide clear error messages for UI consumers
- **Retry Logic:** Implement exponential backoff for transient failures
- **Circuit Breaker:** Prevent cascade failures in project discovery service

## Code Review Guidelines

### Primary Review Focus Areas:
1. **Database Query Performance:** Ensure queries use proper indexes and are optimized
2. **Error Handling Completeness:** Verify all edge cases have appropriate error responses
3. **Backward Compatibility:** Confirm existing API consumers continue working
4. **Test Coverage:** Validate 100% coverage for new project discovery logic
5. **Migration Safety:** Review data migration script for rollback capability
6. **Security Considerations:** Ensure proper access control for project associations

### Specific Review Checkpoints:
- [ ] Project discovery queries use database indexes effectively
- [ ] API maintains existing request/response contract
- [ ] Migration script includes proper backup and rollback procedures
- [ ] All error conditions return appropriate HTTP status codes
- [ ] New functionality includes comprehensive logging
