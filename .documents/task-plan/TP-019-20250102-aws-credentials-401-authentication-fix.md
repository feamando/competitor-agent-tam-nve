## Implementation Guidelines

### Key Approaches
- **Authentication Bypass:** Ensure credentials endpoint doesn't require session authentication
- **Rate Limiting:** Configure appropriate rate limits for security without blocking legitimate use
- **Error Handling:** Provide clear, actionable error messages to users
- **Security:** Maintain security while fixing accessibility issues

### Relevant File Paths
- API Routes: `src/app/api/aws/credentials/route.ts`
- Frontend Form: `src/components/aws/AWSCredentialsModal.tsx`
- Service Layer: `src/services/aws/awsCredentialService.ts`
- Middleware: `src/middleware.ts`, `src/middleware/security.ts`
- Rate Limiter: `src/lib/rateLimiter.ts`

### Security Considerations
- Ensure credentials are properly encrypted before database storage
- Validate input data to prevent injection attacks
- Maintain audit logging for credential operations
- Apply rate limiting to prevent abuse while allowing legitimate usage

## Edge Cases & Error Handling

### Edge Cases to Consider
1. **Network Timeouts:** Slow database connections causing request timeouts
2. **Concurrent Requests:** Multiple credential save attempts simultaneously
3. **Invalid Credentials:** Malformed AWS credential data
4. **Database Errors:** Connection issues or constraint violations
5. **Rate Limit Edge Cases:** Legitimate users hitting rate limits during testing

### Error Handling Strategy
- Return specific HTTP status codes for different error types
- Provide user-friendly error messages in the frontend
- Log detailed error information for debugging
- Implement proper retry logic for transient failures
- Handle database connection errors gracefully

## Code Review Guidelines

### Focus Areas for Review
- **Security:** Verify authentication bypass doesn't introduce security vulnerabilities
- **Rate Limiting:** Ensure rate limits are appropriate and don't block legitimate usage
- **Error Handling:** Check that all error paths are properly handled
- **Database Operations:** Verify credential storage and encryption are working
- **Frontend Integration:** Ensure error messages are displayed to users

### Testing Checklist
- All error scenarios return appropriate HTTP status codes
- Frontend displays meaningful error messages
- Database operations complete successfully
- Rate limiting works without blocking legitimate requests
- CORS headers are properly configured

## Acceptance Testing Checklist

### Functional Tests
- [ ] User can successfully save valid AWS credentials
- [ ] Invalid credentials are rejected with clear error messages
- [ ] Saved credentials are properly encrypted in database
- [ ] Credentials can be retrieved and used for AWS operations
- [ ] Frontend displays appropriate loading states and error messages

### Non-Functional Tests
- [ ] API endpoints respond within reasonable time limits
- [ ] Rate limiting prevents abuse while allowing legitimate usage
- [ ] No authentication is required for credential operations
- [ ] Error responses include helpful debugging information
- [ ] Database operations are properly logged and audited

### Security Tests
- [ ] Credentials are encrypted before database storage
- [ ] No sensitive data is exposed in error messages or logs
- [ ] Input validation prevents injection attacks
- [ ] Rate limiting prevents brute force attacks
- [ ] Authentication bypass doesn't expose unauthorized endpoints

## Notes / Open Questions

### Assumptions Made
- The 401 error is caused by incorrect authentication middleware application
- Rate limiting may be too restrictive for credential operations
- CORS configuration may need adjustment for API calls

### Future Improvements
- Consider implementing credential validation during save operation
- Add credential expiration tracking and renewal notifications
- Implement more granular rate limiting per operation type
- Add comprehensive audit logging for credential operations

### Monitoring Considerations
- Track credential save success/failure rates
- Monitor API response times for performance degradation
- Alert on unusual authentication failure patterns
- Log rate limit violations for analysis
