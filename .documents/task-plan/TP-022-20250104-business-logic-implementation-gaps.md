# Business Logic Implementation Gaps - Task Plan

## Overview
**Project Name:** Competitor Research Agent  
**Date:** January 4, 2025  
**RequestID:** TP-022-20250104-business-logic-implementation-gaps  

**Goal:** Address critical business logic implementation gaps identified in CR-117 and CR-118 analysis, based on current system status review. Focus on genuine implementation gaps rather than infrastructure issues that have been resolved.

**Scope:** Core business logic components including conversation manager state management, analysis service factory method connections, and content validation workflows. Note: Many infrastructure issues from original assessment have been addressed in subsequent completion reports.

## Pre-requisites
- Access to application codebase and development environment
- Node.js and npm/yarn installed
- Database access (PostgreSQL/SQLite) for testing business logic
- Understanding of chat workflow, report generation pipeline, and analysis services
- Git access to create feature branches

**Git Branch Creation:**
```bash
git checkout -b feature/business-logic-implementation-gaps-20250104-TP-022
```

## Dependencies
- **Core Services:** ConversationManager, AnalysisService, ReportGenerationService
- **Framework:** Next.js, TypeScript, Prisma ORM
- **Business Logic:** Chat state management, report validation, emergency fallback systems
- **Testing:** Jest unit tests, integration test infrastructure
- **External Dependencies:** AWS services, data validation libraries

**Code Owners:** (Check .claim.json for specific ownership)
- Chat/Conversation logic: Frontend/UX team
- Report generation: Analytics team
- Analysis services: Data processing team

## Task Breakdown

### ⚠️ **CRITICAL CORRECTIONS BASED ON COMPLETION REPORT ANALYSIS:**

**Status Review Date:** January 4, 2025

1. **✅ Analysis Service Implementations EXIST:** AIAnalyzer is fully implemented (543 lines) at `src/services/domains/analysis/AIAnalyzer.ts` but factory methods are not connected.

2. **✅ Emergency Fallback System IMPLEMENTED:** Per CR-099-20250801-emergency-fallback-system, comprehensive emergency fallback with circuit breakers is complete.

3. **✅ Project Creation AWS Issues LARGELY RESOLVED:** Per CR-116-20250804-chat-aws-fix, core chat project creation failures with AWS credentials are fixed.

4. **❓ Zombie Reports Status UNCLEAR:** TP-016 zombie report fix was created but no completion report found - needs validation.

**Updated Focus:** Connect existing implementations rather than building from scratch, validate completed systems rather than re-implementing.
