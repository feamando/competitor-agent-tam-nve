# Technical Task Plan: Analysis & Reporting Domain Consolidation - Phase 1.4 & 1.5

## Overview
* **Goal:** Consolidate Analysis Domain Services (ComparativeAnalysisService, UserExperienceAnalyzer, SmartAIService) into unified AnalysisService and Reporting Domain Services (ReportGenerator, IntelligentReportingService, AutoReportGenerationService) into unified ReportingService for architectural stability
* **Project Name:** Competitor Research Agent v1.5 - Domain Consolidation
* **Date:** July 22, 2025  
* **Request ID:** REQ001-TASK-1.4-1.5

This plan addresses the consolidation of over-engineered Analysis and Reporting domain services into two unified services that maintain all critical functionality while reducing architectural complexity. Focus on preserving critical data flows identified in the system health audit while eliminating tight coupling patterns.

## Pre-requisites
* Node.js 18+ and npm installed
* Existing service architecture analysis completed
* Database connectivity with Prisma client
* AWS Bedrock service credentials configured
* Understanding of critical data flows: `SmartAIService → IntelligentReportingService → AutoReportGenerationService`
* **Git Branch Creation:** `git checkout -b feature/analysis_reporting_domain_consolidation_20250722_REQ001`
* Feature flag system for gradual rollout of consolidated services
* Backup of current service implementations in case of rollback need

## Dependencies
* **Internal Service Dependencies:**
  - `SmartSchedulingService` - Critical for data freshness checks (must be preserved)
  - `BedrockService` - AI/ML operations (used by both domains)
  - `WebScraperService` - Data collection integration
  - `ProductScrapingService` - Product data pipeline
  - Database schema: `Project`, `Product`, `Competitor`, `Report`, `Snapshot` entities
* **External Libraries:**
  - AWS Bedrock SDK for AI operations
  - Prisma ORM for database operations  
  - Bull queue system for report processing
  - Node-cron for scheduling operations
* **Code Owners:** Based on .claim.json analysis - services owned by core platform team

## Implementation Guidelines

### Service Consolidation Patterns
```typescript
// New Unified AnalysisService Structure
export class AnalysisService {
  private aiAnalyzer: AIAnalyzer;
  private uxAnalyzer: UXAnalyzer;
  private comparativeAnalyzer: ComparativeAnalyzer;
  private bedrockService: BedrockService;
  private smartSchedulingService: SmartSchedulingService;

  constructor() {
    this.bedrockService = new BedrockService();
    this.smartSchedulingService = new SmartSchedulingService();
    this.aiAnalyzer = new AIAnalyzer(this.bedrockService, this.smartSchedulingService);
    this.uxAnalyzer = new UXAnalyzer(this.bedrockService);
    this.comparativeAnalyzer = new ComparativeAnalyzer(this.bedrockService);
  }

  // Unified interface combining all analysis capabilities
  async analyzeProduct(request: UnifiedAnalysisRequest): Promise<UnifiedAnalysisResponse> {
    const { analysisType, productData, competitorData, options } = request;
    
    switch (analysisType) {
      case 'ai_comprehensive':
        return this.aiAnalyzer.analyzeWithSmartScheduling(request);
      case 'ux_comparison':
        return this.uxAnalyzer.analyzeProductVsCompetitors(productData, competitorData, options);
      case 'comparative_analysis':
        return this.comparativeAnalyzer.analyzeProductVsCompetitors(request);
      default:
        throw new Error(`Unsupported analysis type: ${analysisType}`);
    }
  }
}
```

### Reporting Service Pattern
```typescript
// New Unified ReportingService Structure
export class ReportingService {
  private reportGenerator: ReportGenerator;
  private reportScheduler: ReportScheduler;
  private reportProcessor: ReportProcessor;
  private analysisService: AnalysisService;
  private reportQueue: Bull.Queue;

  constructor() {
    this.analysisService = new AnalysisService();
    this.reportQueue = new Bull('comparative-reports', {
      redis: { host: process.env.REDIS_HOST, port: process.env.REDIS_PORT }
    });
    this.reportGenerator = new ReportGenerator(this.analysisService);
    this.reportScheduler = new ReportScheduler(this.reportQueue);
    this.reportProcessor = new ReportProcessor(this.reportQueue);
  }

  // Only comparative reports supported (as per requirements)
  async generateComparativeReport(request: ComparativeReportRequest): Promise<ComparativeReportResponse> {
    // Validate request is for comparative analysis only
    if (request.reportType !== 'comparative') {
      throw new Error('Only comparative reports are supported in v1.5');
    }

    // Generate analysis using consolidated AnalysisService
    const analysis = await this.analysisService.analyzeProduct({
      analysisType: 'comparative_analysis',
      productData: request.productData,
      competitorData: request.competitorData,
      options: request.analysisOptions
    });

    // Generate report in markdown format only
    return this.reportGenerator.generateMarkdownReport(analysis, request.reportOptions);
  }
}
```

### Critical Data Flow Preservation
```typescript
// Preserve Smart Scheduling → AI Analysis → Report Generation Flow
class AnalysisService {
  async analyzeWithDataFreshness(request: AnalysisRequest): Promise<AnalysisResponse> {
    // Step 1: Check data freshness (preserve existing logic)
    const freshnessStatus = await this.smartSchedulingService.getFreshnessStatus(request.projectId);
    
    // Step 2: Trigger scraping if needed (preserve existing logic)
    if (request.forceFreshData || freshnessStatus.overallStatus !== 'FRESH') {
      await this.smartSchedulingService.checkAndTriggerScraping(request.projectId);
    }
    
    // Step 3: Generate analysis with fresh data context (consolidated logic)
    return this.aiAnalyzer.generateAnalysis(request, freshnessStatus);
  }
}
```

## Edge Cases & Error Handling

### Service Consolidation Risks
- **Analysis Quality Degradation**: Monitor analysis confidence scores and response times
- **Report Generation Failures**: Implement comprehensive fallback to individual analysis services
- **Memory Usage Spikes**: Monitor memory consumption during consolidated operations
- **Queue Processing Issues**: Implement queue health monitoring and automatic recovery

### Data Flow Preservation Risks
- **Smart Scheduling Integration**: Validate data freshness workflows continue to function
- **Analysis Pipeline Breaks**: Monitor end-to-end analysis → report generation workflows
- **Database Query Changes**: Ensure consolidated services don't introduce N+1 query problems
- **AI Service Failures**: Implement proper fallback mechanisms for Bedrock service issues

### Migration Strategy Risks
- **Feature Flag Failures**: Implement monitoring and automatic rollback for feature flag issues
- **Partial Migration Issues**: Ensure consistent behavior during gradual rollout
- **Performance Regression**: Monitor response times and automatically rollback if degradation detected
- **Data Consistency**: Validate that report data remains consistent during service transition

- **Performance Impact**: Verify no performance regression in analysis or report generation
- **Error Handling**: Confirm comprehensive error handling with proper correlation ID tracking
- **Memory Management**: Review memory usage patterns, especially for large analysis operations
- **Code Quality**: Ensure consolidated services follow existing patterns and conventions

### Critical Flow Validation
- **Smart Scheduling**: Verify data freshness checking and scraping trigger logic is preserved
- **Analysis Quality**: Confirm analysis results maintain quality and confidence scores
- **Report Format**: Ensure reports are generated in markdown format only as specified
- **Queue Processing**: Verify Bull queue integration continues to work properly

### Testing Requirements
- **Integration Tests**: All critical user workflows must have integration test coverage
- **Performance Tests**: Load testing for consolidated services under realistic conditions
- **Rollback Tests**: Verify feature flag rollback works correctly under various conditions
