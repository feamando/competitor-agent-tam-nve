## Implementation Guidelines

### Electron Architecture Pattern
- **Main Process:** Handles application lifecycle, window management, and system integration
- **Renderer Process:** Next.js application running in Chromium
- **Preload Scripts:** Secure bridge between main and renderer processes

### Security Considerations
- Enable context isolation and disable node integration in renderer
- Implement secure IPC channels for sensitive operations
- Validate all external inputs and API responses
- Use encrypted storage for sensitive configuration data

├── electron-builder.json     # Build configuration
└── next.config.ts           # Modified for Electron compatibility
```

### Database Strategy
- **Local Option:** Embed SQLite for offline-first experience
- **Hybrid Option:** Local SQLite with cloud sync capability
- **Remote Option:** Maintain PostgreSQL connection with local caching

### Background Services Integration
- Web scraping operations via Puppeteer in main process
- Scheduled jobs using node-cron in background
- Redis connection management for job queues
- AWS service integration with proper credential handling

## Edge Cases & Error Handling

### Platform-Specific Issues
- **macOS:** Handle Gatekeeper, notarization, and sandbox restrictions
- **Windows:** Address Windows Defender false positives and UAC permissions
- **Linux:** Manage different distribution package formats and dependencies

### Network Connectivity
- Implement offline mode with limited functionality
- Handle AWS service unavailability gracefully
- Provide clear user feedback for network-dependent features

### Resource Management
- Monitor memory usage for large web scraping operations
- Implement proper cleanup for Puppeteer browser instances
- Handle disk space constraints for local data storage

### Security Considerations
- Validate all external URLs before scraping
- Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Secure storage of API keys and credentials

## Code Review Guidelines

### Security Review Points
- Verify context isolation is enabled in all renderer processes
- Ensure no direct node.js access from renderer processes
- Validate all IPC message handlers have proper input validation
- Check that sensitive data is encrypted at rest

### Performance Review Points
- Monitor main process memory usage and prevent leaks
- Ensure efficient IPC communication patterns
- Validate proper cleanup of background services
- Test startup time across different platforms

### Cross-Platform Compatibility

## Notes / Open Questions

### Architecture Decisions
- **Database Strategy:** Should we implement local SQLite for offline capability or maintain PostgreSQL-only approach?
- **Update Mechanism:** Implement incremental updates or full application replacement?
- **Packaging Size:** Balance between functionality and application size (current web app has extensive dependencies)

### Future Enhancements
- Consider implementing a mobile companion app
- Explore integration with system-specific features (macOS Spotlight, Windows Search)
- Evaluate potential for plugin architecture for extensibility

### Compliance Considerations
- Review data privacy requirements for desktop application
- Ensure GDPR compliance for local data storage
- Validate export restrictions for AI/ML capabilities

### Performance Optimizations
- Investigate lazy loading strategies for electron modules
- Consider implementing worker processes for CPU-intensive operations
- Evaluate caching strategies for frequently accessed data

**Estimated Timeline:** 4-6 weeks for complete implementation and testing  
**Team Requirements:** 2-3 developers with Electron experience  
**Risk Level:** Medium (due to complex service integrations and multi-platform requirements)
