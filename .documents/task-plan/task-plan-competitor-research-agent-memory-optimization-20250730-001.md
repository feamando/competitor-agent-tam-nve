  - Add request rejection when memory usage exceeds 85%
  - Implement gradual degradation (disable non-essential features)
- [ ] 3.2 **Add Memory Profiling Utilities** (Small)
  - Create `src/lib/debug/memoryProfiler.ts` for development debugging
  - Add heap dump generation on memory threshold breach
  - Implement memory usage tracking per API endpoint
  - Add memory usage metrics to existing logging system

### - [ ] 4.0 Production Readiness & Configuration (Medium Priority)
- [ ] 4.1 **Add Node.js Memory Configuration** (Small)
  - Update `package.json` scripts to include `--max_old_space_size=4096`
  - Add environment-specific memory limits
  - Configure garbage collection optimization flags
  - Add memory usage monitoring to health checks
- [ ] 4.2 **Implement Request Rate Limiting** (Medium)
  - Create `src/middleware/rateLimiting.ts` for analysis endpoints
  - Limit concurrent report generation to 3 per user
  - Add cooldown periods between large analysis requests
  - Implement user-specific request queuing

## Implementation Guidelines

### Key Technologies & Patterns:
- **Memory Management:** Use WeakMap/WeakSet for temporary object references
- **Streaming Processing:** Replace large JSON operations with stream-based processing
- **Queue Implementation:** Utilize p-queue library for robust request queuing
- **Cleanup Patterns:** Implement disposable pattern with explicit resource cleanup

### Critical Code Locations:
- `src/services/bedrock/bedrock.service.ts` - AI service memory management
- `src/lib/reports.ts` - Report generation optimization
- `src/lib/chat/conversation.ts` - Chat state management
- `src/lib/monitoring/ComprehensiveMemoryMonitor.ts` - Memory monitoring enhancements

### Performance Considerations:
- Target <400MB heap usage for normal operations
- Keep AI request processing under 30 seconds
- Maintain garbage collection frequency below 10/minute
- Ensure system memory stays below 85% under normal load

## Edge Cases & Error Handling

### Memory Pressure Scenarios:
- **Queue Overflow:** Reject new requests with 503 Service Unavailable
- **Analysis Timeout:** Clean up partial results and notify user
- **Service Degradation:** Disable advanced features, maintain core functionality
- **Critical Memory:** Force restart mechanism with graceful connection handling

### Error Recovery Strategies:
- Implement exponential backoff for failed cleanup operations
- Add fallback mechanisms for AI service failures
- Provide partial results when full analysis cannot complete
- Log all memory-related errors with correlation IDs for debugging

## Code Review Guidelines

### Critical Review Points:
- **Memory Cleanup:** Verify all large objects are explicitly nullified after use
- **Queue Implementation:** Ensure proper error handling and timeout management
- **Resource Disposal:** Check that all services implement proper cleanup methods
- **Performance Impact:** Validate that optimizations don't degrade analysis quality
- **Error Handling:** Confirm graceful degradation under memory pressure

### Testing Requirements:
- Memory leak detection using heap snapshots
- Load testing with concurrent analysis requests  
- Stress testing under various memory pressure scenarios
- Validation of analysis result quality after optimizations

## Acceptance Testing Checklist

### Functional Requirements:
- [ ] System memory usage stays below 85% during normal operations
- [ ] Heap usage remains under 400MB for typical analysis workflows
- [ ] AI analysis requests complete within 30-second timeout
- [ ] Chat conversations maintain history without memory leaks
- [ ] Report generation handles multiple competitors without crashes

### Performance Requirements:
- [ ] Garbage collection frequency reduced to <10 cycles/minute
- [ ] Emergency memory cleanup no longer triggered during normal use
- [ ] AI request queue processing maintains <5-second average wait time
- [ ] System remains responsive during concurrent analysis operations

### Quality Assurance:
- [ ] Analysis result accuracy maintained after optimization changes
- [ ] Error handling provides meaningful user feedback
- [ ] Memory monitoring alerts function properly at new thresholds

## Notes / Open Questions

### Future Improvements:
- Consider implementing Redis-based conversation storage for horizontal scaling
- Evaluate migrating to streaming AI responses for large analyses
- Assess feasibility of background processing for non-urgent reports
- Review potential for database query optimization to reduce memory usage

### Technical Debt:
- Legacy JSON stringification patterns throughout codebase need systematic replacement
- Memory monitoring system could benefit from integration with external APM tools
- Consider implementing memory usage budgets per user/tenant for multi-tenancy support

### Risk Mitigation:
- Implement feature flags for new memory management features
- Plan rollback strategy if optimizations negatively impact functionality
- Consider gradual rollout with A/B testing for production deployment
- Ensure monitoring systems can detect regression in memory usage patterns
