# Rollback Procedures and Decision Criteria

**Document Version:** 1.0  
**Task:** 8.3 - Rollback Testing  
**Date:** July 28, 2025  
**Status:** Production Ready

## üéØ Overview

This document defines the procedures, decision criteria, and automated processes for rolling back from consolidated services (Analysis v1.5 & Reporting v1.5) to legacy services in case of production issues.

## üö® Rollback Decision Criteria

### Automatic Rollback Triggers

The following conditions will trigger an **automatic rollback** to legacy services:

#### 1. Error Rate Thresholds
- **Analysis Service Error Rate > 10%** over 5-minute window
- **Reporting Service Error Rate > 10%** over 5-minute window
- **Overall System Error Rate > 5%** over 3-minute window

#### 2. Response Time Thresholds
- **Analysis Service P95 > 90 seconds** over 5-minute window
- **Reporting Service P95 > 120 seconds** over 5-minute window
- **Critical API Endpoints P95 > 60 seconds** over 3-minute window

#### 3. Resource Utilization Thresholds
- **Memory Usage > 2GB** sustained for 3 minutes
- **CPU Usage > 95%** sustained for 2 minutes
- **Database Connection Pool > 90%** for 2 minutes

#### 4. Service Health Failures
- **Health Check Failures > 3 consecutive** within 2 minutes
- **Service Unavailable (503) > 5 requests** within 1 minute
- **Database Connectivity Failures** detected

### Manual Rollback Triggers

The following conditions require **manual assessment** and potential rollback:

#### 1. Quality Degradation
- Customer reports of analysis quality issues
- Significant deviation in report content quality
- Data consistency issues between services

#### 2. Performance Degradation
- Gradual performance decline over time
- Memory leak detection
- Increased resource consumption trends

#### 3. Business Impact
- Customer-facing functionality failures
- Critical workflow interruptions
- Revenue-impacting service disruptions

#### 4. Security Concerns
- Potential security vulnerabilities discovered
- Unusual traffic patterns or potential attacks
- Data integrity concerns

## üîÑ Rollback Procedures

### Phase 1: Emergency Rollback (< 2 minutes)

#### Immediate Actions
1. **Disable Consolidated Services**
   ```bash
   # Set feature flags for emergency rollback
   curl -X POST "http://localhost:3000/api/admin/feature-flags" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_TOKEN" \
     -d '{
       "CONSOLIDATED_ANALYSIS_V15": false,
       "CONSOLIDATED_REPORTING_V15": false,
       "LEGACY_SERVICES_FALLBACK": true,
       "reason": "Emergency rollback - [REASON]"
     }'
   ```

2. **Verify Legacy Services Health**
   ```bash
   # Check legacy service availability
   curl -f http://localhost:3000/api/health/legacy
   curl -f http://localhost:3000/api/analysis/health
   curl -f http://localhost:3000/api/reports/health
   ```

3. **Monitor Traffic Shift**
   - Verify traffic is routing to legacy services
   - Check error rates drop within 1 minute
   - Confirm response times improve

#### Emergency Rollback Script
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Emergency rollback to legacy services

echo "üö® EMERGENCY ROLLBACK INITIATED"
echo "Timestamp: $(date)"
echo "Reason: $1"

# Set feature flags
kubectl set env deployment/api-service \
  CONSOLIDATED_ANALYSIS_V15=false \
  CONSOLIDATED_REPORTING_V15=false \
  LEGACY_SERVICES_FALLBACK=true

# Wait for deployment rollout
kubectl rollout status deployment/api-service --timeout=60s

# Verify health
if curl -f http://localhost:3000/api/health > /dev/null 2>&1; then
  echo "‚úÖ Emergency rollback completed successfully"
  exit 0
else
  echo "‚ùå Emergency rollback failed - manual intervention required"
  exit 1
fi
```

### Phase 2: Controlled Rollback (< 10 minutes)

#### Detailed Steps
1. **Document Rollback Reason**
   - Create incident ticket with detailed reason
   - Capture metrics and logs from the time of issue
   - Document timeline of events

2. **Gradual Traffic Shift**
   ```bash
   # Gradual rollback with traffic splitting
   # Step 1: 25% traffic to legacy
   kubectl patch service api-service -p '{"spec":{"selector":{"version":"legacy","weight":"25"}}}'
   
   # Step 2: Monitor for 2 minutes, then 50%
   kubectl patch service api-service -p '{"spec":{"selector":{"version":"legacy","weight":"50"}}}'
   
   # Step 3: Monitor for 2 minutes, then 100%
   kubectl patch service api-service -p '{"spec":{"selector":{"version":"legacy","weight":"100"}}}'
   ```

3. **Data Consistency Validation**
   ```bash
   # Run data consistency checks
   npm run test:rollback:consistency
   
   # Validate critical workflows
   npm run test:rollback:workflows
   ```

4. **Service Health Monitoring**
   - Monitor legacy service metrics for 10 minutes
   - Verify error rates remain < 2%
   - Confirm response times meet SLA requirements

### Phase 3: Post-Rollback Validation (< 30 minutes)

#### Validation Steps
1. **End-to-End Testing**
   ```bash
   # Run comprehensive rollback validation
   npm run test:rollback:validation
   ```

2. **Performance Verification**
   - Verify P95 response times < baseline + 10%
   - Confirm memory usage < 1GB
   - Validate throughput meets requirements

3. **User Experience Validation**
   - Test critical user journeys
   - Verify report generation functionality
   - Confirm analysis quality meets standards

4. **Data Integrity Checks**
   - Compare analysis results pre/post rollback
   - Verify report content consistency
   - Validate database state

## üéØ Rollforward Procedures

### When to Rollforward
- Issue causing rollback has been resolved
- Consolidated services pass all validation tests
- Performance metrics show improvement
- Quality assurance tests pass

### Rollforward Process
1. **Pre-Rollforward Checklist**
   - [ ] Issue root cause identified and fixed
   - [ ] Consolidated services deployed with fix
   - [ ] All validation tests pass
   - [ ] Monitoring systems confirmed healthy
   - [ ] Stakeholder approval obtained

2. **Gradual Rollforward**
   ```bash
   # Step 1: Enable consolidated services for 10% traffic
   kubectl set env deployment/api-service \
     CONSOLIDATED_ANALYSIS_V15=true \
     CONSOLIDATED_REPORTING_V15=true \
     LEGACY_SERVICES_FALLBACK=false \
     TRAFFIC_SPLIT_CONSOLIDATED=10
   
   # Step 2: Monitor for 10 minutes, increase to 50%
   kubectl set env deployment/api-service TRAFFIC_SPLIT_CONSOLIDATED=50
   
   # Step 3: Monitor for 10 minutes, increase to 100%
   kubectl set env deployment/api-service TRAFFIC_SPLIT_CONSOLIDATED=100
   ```

3. **Post-Rollforward Monitoring**
   - Monitor for 1 hour with enhanced alerting
   - Validate performance metrics
   - Confirm user feedback is positive
