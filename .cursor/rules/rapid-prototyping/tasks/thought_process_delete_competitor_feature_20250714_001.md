# Thought Process: Delete Competitor Feature
**Strategy Name:** Delete Competitor Feature Implementation
**Date:** 2025-07-14
**Request ID:** 001

## Analysis Phase

### Requirement Understanding
- **Primary Goal:** Add delete functionality to competitor detail pages
- **User Experience:** Single click to delete, with proper confirmation and feedback
- **API Integration:** Leverage existing DELETE endpoint at `/api/competitors/[id]`
- **Testing Requirements:** Both unit and integration test coverage

### Technical Context Assessment
Based on codebase exploration:

1. **Existing Infrastructure:**
   - DELETE API endpoint already exists in `src/app/api/competitors/[id]/route.ts`
   - Competitor detail pages exist but need delete button UI
   - Database operations are handled via Prisma with proper error handling
   - Logging and correlation tracking already implemented

2. **UI Architecture:**
   - Next.js 13+ with App Router
   - React components in `src/components/competitors/`
   - Competitor detail pages in `src/app/competitors/[id]/`
   - Existing patterns for API calls and state management

3. **Testing Infrastructure:**
   - Jest setup for unit tests in `src/__tests__/`
   - Integration tests in `src/__tests__/integration/`
   - Existing test patterns for competitor operations

### Technical Feasibility
- **High Confidence:** All required infrastructure exists
- **Low Risk:** Standard CRUD operation with existing patterns
- **Dependencies:** No external dependencies required

### Key Considerations
1. **User Experience:** Need confirmation dialog to prevent accidental deletions
2. **Error Handling:** Proper feedback for success/failure scenarios  
3. **Navigation:** Redirect to competitors list after successful deletion
4. **Database Integrity:** Existing API handles cascading deletes for related data
5. **Testing:** Cover both happy path and error scenarios

### Architecture Decisions
1. **Component Structure:** Create reusable DeleteButton component
2. **State Management:** Use React hooks for local state, no Redux needed
3. **API Integration:** Direct fetch calls following existing patterns
4. **User Feedback:** Toast notifications for operation feedback
5. **Confirmation Flow:** Modal dialog with explicit confirmation

### Assumptions Made
- User wants immediate deletion without complex approval workflows
- Existing API error handling is sufficient
- Standard confirmation dialog UX is acceptable
- Current test infrastructure patterns should be followed

### Initial Implementation Ideas
1. Create `DeleteCompetitorButton` component with confirmation modal
2. Integrate button into competitor detail page
3. Handle API calls with proper error states
4. Add navigation logic post-deletion
5. Create comprehensive test suite covering all scenarios
