# Thought Process: CompAI Prompt Integration

**RequestID:** TP-014-20250801-compai-prompt-integration
**Date:** 2025-08-01
**Analysis Phase:** Complete

## Initial Assessment

The user's request involves updating the AI prompt system to use the CompAI prompt structure instead of the current generic prompts. This is a significant architectural change that affects multiple services and the core AI analysis functionality.

## System Analysis Findings

### Current Prompt Architecture

**Key Services Using Prompts:**
1. **SmartAIService** - `buildEnhancedPrompt()` method generates dynamic prompts with data freshness context
2. **ComparativeAnalyzer** - `buildAnalysisPrompt()` uses template-based approach with variable replacement
3. **ReportGenerator** - `buildComparativeAnalysisPrompt()` creates simpler prompts for basic analysis
4. **Various Template Files** - `analysisPrompts.ts` contains structured prompt templates

**Current Data Flow:**
```
Project Data (DB) → Prompt Builder → Bedrock Service → Claude AI → Analysis Results
```

**Existing Prompt Structure:**
- Generic business intelligence focused
- Simple variable replacement approach
- Data freshness integration from SmartScheduling
- Multiple analysis types (competitive, trend, comprehensive)

### CompAI Prompt Analysis

**CompAI Template Characteristics:**
- Highly structured with specific sections (Executive Summary, Competitor Profiles, etc.)
- Expects HTML content from website scraping
- Requires specific output format (detailed markdown report)
- Role-based system prompt (Senior Market Analyst)
- Comprehensive analysis framework

**Key Differences:**
- Current system: Generic analysis → CompAI: Specialized competitive intelligence
- Current system: JSON/simple text output → CompAI: Structured markdown report
- Current system: Variable data sources → CompAI: Specific data source requirements

## Compatibility Assessment

### Data Model Mapping
✅ **Compatible Elements:**
- Project, Product, Competitor models align with CompAI requirements
- Snapshot content can provide HTML data for analysis
- Data freshness tracking can be integrated with analysis date requirements

⚠️ **Adaptation Required:**
- CompAI expects specific placeholders that don't directly match current data structure
- Output format needs to be adapted to application's existing analysis interfaces
- HTML content extraction from JSON snapshot structure needed

❌ **Missing Elements:**
- CompAI template assumes file-based HTML content (our system uses JSON snapshots)
- Some CompAI sections may not align with current analysis response formats

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Analysis & Mapping
- Document all current prompt usage points
- Create mapping between CompAI placeholders and database fields
- Assess data transformation requirements

### Phase 2: Adaptation
- Modify CompAI template to work with application data structure
- Create data formatting utilities for HTML content extraction
- Integrate with existing data freshness system

### Phase 3: Implementation
- Update all prompt-building services
- Maintain backward compatibility
- Preserve existing BedrockService integration

### Phase 4: Testing & Deployment
- Comprehensive testing with real project data
- Performance validation
- Gradual rollout with feature flags

## Risk Assessment

**High Risks:**
- Breaking existing analysis functionality during migration
- Performance impact from larger, more complex prompts
- Output format changes affecting downstream consumers

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Feature flag implementation for gradual rollout
- Extensive testing with existing project data
- Backward compatibility maintenance
- Performance monitoring and optimization

## Key Design Decisions

1. **Preserve Existing Architecture:** Keep BedrockService interface unchanged
2. **Data Transformation Layer:** Create utilities to format data for CompAI template
3. **Gradual Migration:** Use feature flags to enable CompAI prompt per project/user
4. **Template Adaptation:** Modify CompAI template to use actual database fields rather than file placeholders

## Technical Challenges Identified

1. **Content Size Management:** CompAI expects full HTML content which may exceed token limits
2. **Multi-service Coordination:** Updates needed across 5+ services simultaneously  
3. **Output Format Consistency:** Ensuring CompAI output matches existing analysis interfaces
4. **Performance Impact:** Larger prompts may increase generation time and costs

## Confidence Assessment

**High Confidence Areas:**
- Understanding current system architecture
- Data model compatibility 
- Technical feasibility of integration

**Medium Confidence Areas:**
- Performance impact estimation
- Exact output format requirements
- Migration complexity

**Low Confidence Areas:**
- User acceptance of output format changes
- Long-term maintenance implications

## Next Steps Prioritization

1. **Immediate:** Document current prompt structures comprehensively
2. **Short-term:** Create CompAI template adaptation and data mapping
3. **Medium-term:** Implement service updates with feature flag support
4. **Long-term:** Full rollout with performance optimization

This analysis provides sufficient confidence to proceed with the detailed task plan generation.
