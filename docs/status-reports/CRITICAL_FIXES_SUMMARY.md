# Critical Issues Fixed - Summary

## üö® Issue 1: Missing Report API Endpoint
**Problem**: The `/api/reports/[id]` route was missing, preventing report viewing.

**Solution**: ‚úÖ **FIXED**
- Created `src/app/api/reports/[id]/route.ts`
- Implemented GET endpoint for retrieving individual reports
- Added proper error handling and logging
- Supports both HEAD and GET methods
- Returns complete report data with version information

**Test**: 
```bash
curl "http://localhost:3000/api/reports/[REPORT_ID]"
```

## üö® Issue 2: Database Schema JSON Field Queries
**Problem**: ProductSnapshot `content` field queries were using incorrect Prisma syntax for JSON fields, causing database errors.

**Solution**: ‚úÖ **FIXED**
- Fixed JSON field queries in `src/services/systemHealthService.ts`
- Changed `{ content: null }` to `{ content: { equals: null } }`
- Updated error field references to use correct schema field names
- Fixed queries in multiple services:
  - System Health Service
  - Performance Monitoring Service  
  - Advanced Scheduling Service

**Before** (‚ùå Broken):
```typescript
prisma.productSnapshot.count({
  where: {
    OR: [{ content: null }, { error: { not: null } }]
  }
})
```

**After** (‚úÖ Fixed):
```typescript
prisma.productSnapshot.count({
  where: {
    OR: [{ content: { equals: null } }, { errorMessage: { not: null } }]
  }
})
```

## üéØ Verification Results

### System Health Status: ‚úÖ WORKING
```json
{
  "services": [
    {"serviceName": "Database", "status": "HEALTHY"},
    {"serviceName": "Smart Scheduling", "status": "HEALTHY"},  
    {"serviceName": "Report Scheduling", "status": "HEALTHY"}
  ],
  "overallStatus": "CRITICAL", // Due to other services, not database
  "healthScore": 30
}
```

### Report API: ‚úÖ WORKING
- Endpoint created and responding
- Proper error handling for missing reports
- Returns structured JSON response

## üìä Impact

**Before Fixes**:
- System health monitoring completely broken
- Report viewing impossible
- Database queries failing with JSON field errors

**After Fixes**:
- ‚úÖ Database service: HEALTHY
- ‚úÖ Core report viewing functional
- ‚úÖ System monitoring operational
- ‚úÖ JSON field queries working correctly

## üîß Files Modified

1. **NEW**: `src/app/api/reports/[id]/route.ts` - Report viewing endpoint
2. **FIXED**: `src/services/systemHealthService.ts` - Database JSON queries
3. **FIXED**: `src/services/performanceMonitoringService.ts` - JSON field syntax
4. **FIXED**: `src/services/advancedSchedulingService.ts` - Snapshot filtering

## ‚úÖ Status: CRITICAL ISSUES RESOLVED

Both critical issues have been successfully fixed:
- ‚úÖ Report API endpoint now exists and functions
- ‚úÖ Database schema JSON queries corrected and working
- ‚úÖ System health monitoring operational
- ‚úÖ Core functionality restored

The remaining issues in the system health report are related to different service field mismatches, not the core database schema problems that were blocking basic functionality.
