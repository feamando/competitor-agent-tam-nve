# Cross-Browser Testing Documentation

## Overview

This document outlines the cross-browser testing strategy implemented for the Competitor Research Agent application. The testing framework ensures consistent functionality and appearance across different browsers and device types.

## Browser Coverage

The automated cross-browser testing infrastructure supports the following browsers:

- **Desktop Browsers**
  - Chrome (latest)
  - Firefox (latest)
  - Safari (latest)
  - Edge (latest via Chromium project)

- **Mobile Browsers**
  - Chrome for Android (via emulation)
  - Safari for iOS (via emulation)
  - Mobile Firefox (via emulation)

- **Tablet Browsers**
  - iPad Safari (via emulation)
  - Android Tablet Chrome (via emulation)

## Testing Infrastructure

### Technology Stack

- **Playwright**: Primary cross-browser testing framework
- **Visual Regression Testing**: Screenshot comparison for UI consistency
- **Reporting**: HTML, JSON, and consolidated dashboard reports
- **CI/CD Integration**: Automated tests run on pull requests and scheduled intervals

## Test Categories

### 1. Visual Regression Tests

Visual regression tests capture screenshots of UI components and compare them against baseline images to detect unexpected visual changes. Key aspects:

- **Component Testing**: Individual UI components tested across browsers
- **Responsive Design**: Tests at multiple viewport sizes
- **Dynamic Content Masking**: Masks dynamic elements to prevent false positives

### 2. Browser-Specific Tests

These tests target known browser quirks and features unique to specific browsers:

- **Chrome-Specific**: Tests for WebKit-specific CSS features (e.g., custom scrollbars)
- **Firefox-Specific**: Form handling and validation behavior tests
- **Safari-Specific**: Position:sticky behavior and iOS-specific rendering tests

### 3. Cross-Browser Functionality Tests

These tests validate that core application functionality works consistently across all browsers:

- **Critical Paths**: Project creation, report generation, data visualization
- **Form Handling**: Input validation, submission, error states
- **Responsive Behavior**: Mobile and tablet layout adaptations

## Running Cross-Browser Tests

### Local Development

To run cross-browser tests locally:

```bash
# Run all cross-browser tests
./scripts/run-cross-browser-tests.sh

# Run tests for a specific browser
npx playwright test --project="chromium-desktop"
npx playwright test --project="firefox-desktop"
npx playwright test --project="webkit-desktop"

# Run only visual regression tests
npx playwright test --grep="@visual"

# View test report
npx playwright show-report test-reports/cross-browser-latest
```

### CI/CD Integration

Cross-browser tests are integrated into the CI/CD pipeline:

- **Pull Requests**: Basic browser compatibility tests run on PRs
- **Nightly Builds**: Full cross-browser suite runs every night
- **Release Process**: Comprehensive cross-browser testing before releases

## Best Practices

### 1. Writing Cross-Browser Tests

- **Consistent Selectors**: Use data-testid attributes for reliable selection
- **Browser Detection**: Use conditional testing for browser-specific behaviors
- **Waiting Strategies**: Implement reliable waits for dynamic content
- **Viewport Configuration**: Test components at multiple screen sizes

### 2. Visual Regression Testing

- **Baseline Management**: Update baselines when intentional visual changes occur
- **Dynamic Content**: Mask dynamic elements (dates, timestamps, etc.)
- **Viewport Coverage**: Test critical components at all major viewport sizes
- **Threshold Configuration**: Set appropriate thresholds for minor rendering differences

### 3. Handling Browser Quirks

- **Progressive Enhancement**: Design tests to accommodate feature differences
- **Graceful Degradation**: Verify fallback behaviors work correctly
- **Feature Detection**: Use capability detection rather than browser detection when possible

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Flaky Tests**
   - Increase timeouts for slower browsers
   - Implement retry mechanisms for network-dependent operations
   - Ensure proper waiting strategies for dynamic content

2. **Visual Differences**
   - Adjust threshold values for comparison sensitivity
   - Mask highly dynamic elements that change frequently
   - Consider browser-specific baseline images

3. **Browser-Specific Failures**
   - Implement browser-specific workarounds when necessary
   - Skip tests that rely on unsupported features
   - Use feature detection to adapt test behavior

## Maintenance and Updates

- **Browser Updates**: Test suite is updated when new browser versions are released
- **Baseline Refreshes**: Visual test baselines are reviewed quarterly
- **Infrastructure Updates**: Testing tools and dependencies kept current

## Conclusion

The cross-browser testing infrastructure ensures that the Competitor Research Agent provides a consistent and reliable experience across different browsers and devices. By automatically catching browser-specific issues before they reach production, the system improves quality and reduces support costs related to browser compatibility issues.
